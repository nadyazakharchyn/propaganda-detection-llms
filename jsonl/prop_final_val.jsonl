John Kerry wasted no time condemning President Trump’s decision not to recertify, and to possibly withdraw from, the disastrous nuclear deal with Iran that Kerry negotiated on behalf of his boss Barack Obama.\nPresident Trump insisted on significant improvements to the Joint Plan of Comprehensive Action (JCPOA), as the deal is formally known.\nThe JCPOA’s fundamental flaws that President Trump wants fixed include Iran’s ability to block unfettered international inspections, the wiggle room that Iran is exploiting to continue developing and testing ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons, and the sunset clause on nuclear enrichment that would provide Iran a clear path to becoming a nuclear armed state after the current restrictions are lifted.\nObama and Kerry had promised that these issues would be dealt with satisfactorily before agreeing to the final terms of the JCPOA.\nInstead they caved to Iranian pressure in order to get the deal done.\nNow that President Trump is trying to clean up the mess Obama and Kerry left him, Kerry has the gall to label President Trump’s decision a \"reckless abandonment of facts in favor of ego and ideology\" and to accuse the Trump administration of “lying to the American people.” It was the Obama administration that recklessly abandoned the facts in pressing ahead with the deal.\nThe Obama administration lied to the American people, abandoning its own promises to ensure that the deal contained ironclad protections.\nMoreover, all that President Trump has done so far is to return the JCPOA to Congress for review.\nHad Obama followed the Constitution and submitted the JCPOA to the Senate as a treaty in the first place, the JCPOA in its present form almost certainly would not have been approved.\nCongress should now have the opportunity to revisit the JCPOA to determine whether the protections that the Obama administration promised are working as advertised.\nCongress should also consider whether time limits on Iran’s commitments continue to make sense in light of what we are now experiencing with Iran’s nuclear technology collaborator, North Korea.\nIt bought time to turn into a full-fledged nuclear power under our noses.\nKerry had promised that the Iranian regime would be prohibited from testing ballistic missiles.\nThis turned out to be a lie.\nAfter the JCPOA was finalized, with no such prohibition included, Iran continued to test such missiles.\nThe Obama administration’s response was that the missiles had become a separate issue, to be dealt with under a new United Nations Security Council resolution endorsing the JCPOA.\nThe new resolution replaced clear prohibitions imposed on Iran’s ballistic missile program with a weak declaration in an annex that simply “calls upon” Iran not to undertake any activity such as development and test launches related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons for eight years.\nIran has tested several ballistic missiles during the last two years, including two Qadr H missiles with the phrase “Israel must be wiped out” emblazoned on the sides.\nThe commander of Iran’s Army, Major General Ataollah Salehi, had told reporters just a month before the launch of those missiles that Iran was \"neither paying any attention to the resolutions against Iran, nor implementing them.\nThis is not a breach of the JCPOA.”\nRussian Ambassador to the United Nations Vitaly Churkin, spurning requests from Obama administration officials to impose sanctions against Iran under the Security Council resolution, asserted that the Iranian missile test did not violate the resolution.\n“A call is different from a ban so legally you cannot violate a call, you can comply with a call or you can ignore the call, but you cannot violate a call,” the Russian ambassador said.\nIn short, the JCPOA did not cover the missile tests and the replacement UN Security Council resolution that did mention the missiles is toothless.\nDeputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes told CNN, during an interview aired on April 6, 2015, that under the deal’s terms then still being negotiated, “you will have anywhere, anytime, 24/7 access as it relates to the nuclear facilities that Iran has.\"\nRhodes claimed that “if we see a site that we need to inspect on a military facility, we can get access to that site and inspect it.\nSo if it's a suspicious site that we believe is related to its nuclear efforts, we can get access and inspect that site through the IAEA.” This was another lie.\nAfter the JCPOA was finalized in July 2015, Rhodes shamelessly denied that anytime, anywhere inspections were ever considered as part of the negotiations.\n“We never sought in this negotiation the capacity for so-called anytime, anywhere,” Rhodes said on July 14, 2015.\nThe JCPOA’s supporters, including Kerry, have made much of the fact that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has on several occasions verified Iran’s compliance with its commitments under the JCPOA, keeping its stock of low-enriched uranium below the limit set forth in the JCPOA and not pursuing further construction of the Arak reactor.\nIran was found to have slightly exceeded the limit on its stock of heavy water, but has remedied the problem to the IAEA’s satisfaction.\nIAEA chief Yukiya Amano reiterated in a statement he issued on October 9th that Iran has remained in compliance with its JCPOA commitments.\nThe problem, as any clear-eyed observer of the process recognizes, is that the IAEA relies on Iran for self-inspection of certain sites that the regime does not want the IAEA to inspect freely on its own.\nIAEA inspectors have avoided examining military sites it knows exists and has no reliable way of tracking undeclared sites.\nThe IAEA’s explanation for not visiting any of Iran’s known military sites is that it had “no reason to ask” for access.\nEvidently, the IAEA is supposed to block out the fact that Iran had conducted tests relevant to nuclear bomb detonations at a military site before the JCPOA’s finalization in 2015.\nThe IAEA should just pretend that such tests could not possibly happen again.\n“Nobody is allowed to visit Iran's military sites,” said Iran’s Head of Strategic Research Center at the Expediency Council and adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, Ali Akbar Velayati.\nIntimidation works.\nThe IAEA knows not to ask.\nAs to the JCPOA’s sunset provisions, the Obama administration lied about that too.\nKerry claimed on September 2, 2015 that the JCPOA “never sunsets.\nThere’s no sunset in this agreement.”\nThis month Kerry has resorted to parsing words.\nHe claims the phrase 'sunset provisions' is a “misnomer,” before then defending the JCPOA’s time limits.\n\"We were comfortable because the cap on Iran’s low-enriched uranium stockpile remains in place until 2030,” Kerry wrote in an article published in the Washington Post late last month.\nIn other words, let’s just kick the can down the road and hope for a more reasonable Iranian regime in 13 years that would agree to extend the time limits.\nIn the meantime, Kerry advises us not to worry.\nKerry declared, “15 or 25 years from now, we still have the same military options we have today.”\nJohn Kerry has obviously learned nothing from the North Korean fiasco, which resulted from years of phony agreements with the rogue regime and so-called “strategic patience.” The United States clearly does not have the same military options today to deal with a nuclear armed North Korea as it did 23 years ago when former President Bill Clinton decided not to use military force to stamp out North Korea’s nuclear program at its inception.\nInstead, Clinton started us down the primrose path of naïve diplomacy with a duplicitous regime that now is on the verge of being able to strike the U.S. mainland with nuclear warheads delivered by intercontinental ballistic missiles.\nIt is precisely because North Korea’s actions over the last 23 years have proven that making concessions to a rogue regime in order to obtain denuclearization commitments is so dangerous that President Trump does not want to make the same mistake with Iran.\nAmerica’s European allies are also upset with President Trump for refusing to recertify the deal and threatening to pull out if certain conditions are not met.\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel issued a joint statement last Friday praising the JCPOA and its implementation.\nThey said that the nuclear deal with Iran was “the culmination of 13 years of diplomacy and was a major step towards ensuring that Iran’s nuclear programme is not diverted for military purposes.\nTherefore, we encourage the US Administration and Congress to consider the implications to the security of the US and its allies before taking any steps that might undermine the JCPOA, such as re-imposing sanctions on Iran lifted under the agreement.”\nPerhaps these European leaders should remember their own history.\nAppeasement through phony deals with a rogue dictatorship does not work, as proven by the infamous Munich Pact signed by British and French Prime Ministers Neville Chamberlain and Edouard Daladier with German Chancellor Adolf Hitler seventy-nine years ago.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":

Mexico compound\n\n(CNN) A New Mexico couple told authorities months ago they thought a missing Georgia boy and his fugitive father were living in a filthy compound on their property.\nBut police did not carry out a search of the property until last week, Taos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe said, because they did not believe they had probable cause in the case.\nThat delay is facing scrutiny in the wake of Monday's discovery of a young boy's remains at the compound.\n\"They were dragging their feet.\nThey were taking too long,\" said Tanya Badger, who with her husband, Jason, told authorities about the boy's suspected presence at the compound.\n\"Even if they were trying to build a case or whatnot, a child's life is at stake.\"\nIt's not clear whether the remains are those of Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj, a child with severe medical problems who disappeared from Georgia about nine months ago.\nThe remains were discovered in a wretched compound along with 11 starving children, authorities said.\nMore details about the horrid compound could be revealed Wednesday when the five adults arrested from the site make their first court appearances.\nAuthorities raided the compound in Amalia, New Mexico, on Friday as part of their search for Abdul-Ghani, whose father, Siraj Wahhaj, allegedly abducted him from Georgia in November.\nNeighbors raised alarm about a suspect\nThe Badgers , whose land the compound was on, said they saw a boy they thought was Abdul-Ghani in January and February.\nIn April, they discovered the boy was listed as missing and his father a fugitive.\nThey reported the sightings to state and local law enforcement, but it was months before police moved in, the couple said.\n\"We are just beyond frustrated that they took so long,\" Tanya Badger said.\nNew Mexico authorities had suspected the father and son might be at the compound after learning about the abduction in May, the sheriff said.\nBut there was not enough evidence for a search warrant, and surveillance of the property didn't identify the pair there.\n\"I had no probable cause to go onto this property,\" Hogrefe said.\n\"In hindsight I wish there was, but we would not have been there lawfully.\"\nThe sheriff said that \"they did surveillance, both ground and aerial, and photographs were shared with the family and mother of the missing boy.\nThe boy Abdul was never identified from those photos.\nMoving forward we knew that there was this compound, but we had very little details about it or who was occupying it.\nThese people just kind of (sprang) up very quickly.\"\nThe authorities' view changed Thursday when they said they received a message about possible starving children living on the compound, and had enough probable cause to put in an affidavit for a search warrant.\n\"We are starving and need food and water,\" the message said, according to authorities.\nAuthorities said it was forwarded to them but did not provide details on its origin.\nCompound wasn't searched thoroughly, couple say\nWhen officers executed a search warrant on the compound, they found a horrifying scene.\nStacks of tires, piles of trash and plastic sheets surrounded the compound.\nObscured by the junk was a trailer where the 11 children and five adults were living.\nThe children wore dirty rags for clothing with no shoes, and were surrounded by weapons and rounds of ammunition, authorities said.\n\"It was the saddest living conditions and poverty I have seen,\" Hogrefe said.\nThe father of the missing boy, Siraj Wahhaj, was arrested at the compound Friday along with his sisters Hujrah Wahhaj and Subhannah Wahhaj and two other adults -- Lucas Morten and Jany Leveille.\nAll have been charged with abuse of the 11 children.\nMorten was charged with harboring a fugitive.\nHowever, the Badgers said that police did not do a thorough job searching the property.\nThe couple said they went back over the weekend after they found out Abdul-Ghani wasn't among the 11 children discovered during the raid.\nTanya and Jason Badger said they told authorities they had seen a boy they thought was Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj.\nThey said they were surprised to see the scene was not taped off and was still largely untouched.\nThey found two guns, ammo, tactical vests and video cameras that police initially missed, Jason Badger said.\n\"When we first went up there, nothing was overturned,\" he said.\n\"You could tell nobody had looked underneath that, nobody had looked underneath this.\"\nFather allegedly took boy in November\nAbdul-Ghani's mother, Hakima Ramzi, could not be reached after authorities announced the discovery of the remains.\nBut hours earlier, Ramzi told CNN she had no idea he'd disappear with their son for nine months, only to be found across the country with 11 other children\n\"My husband said he was taking Abdul-Ghani to the park, and didn't come back.\nThat was in November 2017.\nWhen I would ask him where he was, he said he was on his way, he was coming soon, he was just keeping him for the night.\nBut I haven't seen him since then,\" Ramzi said Tuesday.\nShe said her son cannot walk and suffers seizures, and requires constant medical attention.\nAn arrest warrant states that Wahhaj \"wanted to perform an exorcism\" on the child because he believed he was possessed by the devil.\nBut Ramzi said her husband was planning to perform a ruqya -- an Islamic practice involving prayer that is believed to help rid a body of illness.\n\"It's not an exorcism.\nThat was a translation issue in the court,\" Ramzi said.\nHe \"just wanted to pray for Abdul-Ghani to get better.\"\nPolice stopped the father in Alabama\nIn December, days after Ramzi reported her son missing, the child's father was involved in an accident in Alabama, according to a police report.\nThe SUV had seven children -- but none of them was listed with Abdul-Ghani's date of birth.\nSiraj Wahhaj is accused of fleeing Georgia with his young son.\nBut at the time, the group told Alabama police they were headed to New Mexico for camping, and continued on their way.\nEven though the boy was reported missing, there was no child abduction warrant against Wahhaj because he was married to his son's mother, and they both had equal custody, Clayton County police said.\nThe SUV was registered to Leveille, who was also in the vehicle.\nShe would later become one of the five adults arrested at the compound in New Mexico.\nThe children were taken into protective custody and later turned over to the New Mexico Children, Youth and Families Department.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":

Студент экономического факультета РУДН, второй курс. 21 числа, то бишь в прошлый понедельник, я был на ВТБ-Арене на чествовании нашей Олимпийской сборной, вернувшейся из Пекина. Олимпийцы приехали на мероприятие сильно позже заявленного срока - в 21:00 вечера, вместо 17:00. Нас начали запускать в чашу стадиона где-то в 6, таким образом десятитысячная толпа стояла и ждала три часа. Все эти три часа мы вместе пели песни, танцевали и с нетерпением ждали наших героев. Это чувствовалось. Мы простояли три часа в ожидании тех, кто занял какое-то там место в конце первой десятки. Но это Наши Герои. И мы их дождались, с болью в ногах и разорванным от пения песен горлом. Сейчас те, с кем я там колбасился и пел, пишут \"Нетвойне\" и прочую херню. Те, с кем я орал \"РОССИЯ, РОССИЯ...\", пишут, что им стыдно быть русскими. Странное расхождение получается, не находите? Хочется порубить их всех шашкой, да нельзя - свои же, что не делай. Отсюда возникает необходимость вести просветительскую деятельность. Не пропоганду, детишки от этого слова шугаются. А именно просвещение. Те, кто вопил о нетвойне, быстренько меняли мнение, когда я им показывал, Прости Господи, разорванные тела русских Донбасса. После такого их псевдопацифизм и стыдливость за свой народ резко улетучивались. Им нужно просто показать... всё это. И это не так сложно, в началке в школе мне и моим сверстникам часто рассказывал об ужасах Великой Отечественной. 24 февраля я вспомнил те чувства, что вызвали у меня зверства фашистов. Я вспомнил, что мы победили. Таким образом база у молодёжи есть. Им надо просто напомнить. Про зверства. Они могут гордо кричать \"РОССИЯ\" на стадионе в мирное время. И в военное время они так же гордо могут гордиться своим народом. Им надо чуть напомнить, показать, объяснить. Просвятить.» #РусскийШепот"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Repetition\t1771\t1813\nLoaded_Language\t803\t813\nLoaded_Language\t1564\t1581\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice\t1246\t1279\nFlag-Waving\t842\t866\nDoubt\t904\t949\nFlag-Waving\t535\t553\nExaggeration,Minimisation\t1035\t1084\nLoaded_Language\t1340\t1359\nRepetition\t1172\t1180\nRepetition\t1823\t1858\nExaggeration,Minimisation\t56\t84\nLoaded_Language\t816\t828\nLoaded_Language\t1674\t1686\nLoaded_Language\t958\t981\nLoaded_Language\t1297\t1311\nName_Calling,Labeling\t1263\t1279\nLoaded_Language\t1124\t1132\nLoaded_Language\t779\t789\nFlag-Waving\t668\t682\nRepetition\t668\t682\n"}]}

Renee Hall terminated Police Officer Amber Guyger, #10702, during a hearing held September 24, 2018,” the statement read.\n“An Internal Affairs investigation concluded that on September 9, 2018, Officer Guyger, #10702, engaged in adverse conduct when she was arrested for Manslaughter.”\ntake our poll - story continues below\nWho should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?\nWho should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?\nWho should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?\n* John Bolton Richard Grenell Dina Powell Heather Nauert Ivanka Trump\nEmail *\nEmail This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\nCompleting this poll grants you access to Freedom Outpost updates free of charge.\nYou may opt out at anytime.\nYou also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\nThe department then went on to note that Guyger could appeal this firing under their civil service rules.\nOfficer Guyger was terminated for her actions.\nShe was hired in November 2013 and was assigned to the Southeast Patrol Division.\nUnder civil service rules, Officer Guyger has the right to appeal her discipline.\nThis move is noteworthy as the department has been standing up against those who have been calling for the officer to be fired.\nAs recently as Friday, Hall refused to fire Guyger, saying in part, “There is one overriding reason that I have not taken any administrative or employment action against Officer Amber Guyger.\nI don’t want to interfere with the on-going criminal investigation into her actions.”\nAlso, in a town hall meeting last week, Hall again stood behind her choice to refuse to fire Guyger, claiming it would be against the law.\n“I can’t do that because there are both local, state and federal laws that prohibit me from taking action.\nThere are civil service laws we have to adhere to,” said Hall.\nApparently, it is no longer against the law.\nThis news will likely be well received by the Jean family as well as the activists who have been calling for justice for Botham since the beginning.\nAs TFTP previously reported, the idea of not firing Guyger seemed utterly preposterous as she admitted to doing something wrong.\nWhile controversy swarms the case of why she may have killed Jean, there is no doubt that she did kill him.\nThis is a fact.\nThis public servant walked into an innocent man’s home and shot him dead.\nBecause of her actions, this man no longer lives.\nThis alone should have been enough to fire her.\nSurprisingly enough, NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch responded to the firing of Guyger with one word, “Good,” showing her support for the move.\nFor those who don’t recall, Loesch sparked controversy earlier this month by claiming that if Botham Jean were a gun owner, he may be alive today.\nIndeed, as TFTP reported over the weekend, a father in Prince George’s County opened fire on officers as they wrongly entered his apartment.\nHe shot two officers.\nNot only was he not arrested, but the police chief praised him and apologized.\nIn response to Guyger’s termination, the family’s attorney, Lee Merritt noted that the family expressed “satisfaction” with the move.\n“The Jean family expressed satisfaction in this explanation and in Guyger’s termination.\nWe see it as an initial victory — well received on the day Botham Jean is laid to rest in his native country in St. Lucia,” Merritt’s office said in a statement, adding that they are committed to see a “proper murder indictment, conviction and appropriate sentencing.”\nArticle posted with permission from The Free Thought Project\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Repetition\t2880\t2888\nName_Calling,Labeling\t185\t193\nLoaded_Language\t2658\t2678\nName_Calling,Labeling\t2880\t2888\n"}]}

next to our name, so they know we are a legitimate organization/outlet.\nThey have seen our “Articles of Organization” which was issued by the state of Louisiana, which is where my partner and The Free Thought Project co-founder lives,” Jason Bassler, co-founder of the Free Thought Project explained.\nHowever, in their statement, Facebook then suggested the real reason behind the purge — elections are coming — and pesky folks like the independent media have a way of reporting information on candidates that the mainstream tends to ignore — like war, corruption, and most recently, Brett Kavanaugh’s disdain for the Constitution.\n“Given the activity we’ve seen — and its timing ahead of the US midterm elections — we wanted to give some details about the types of behavior that led to this action,” Facebook said, before accusing us of hawking fake products or functioning as ad farms that tricked “people into thinking that they were forums for legitimate political debate.”\nIt should be stated that TFTP never hid the fact that we worked with other independent media groups to share our information around the web — this is the very definition of grassroots.\nBut all of us together certainly posed a threat to the mainstream so this nonsense about tricking people was brought into play.\nWithin all of our pages under the Free Thought umbrella, we had close to 6 million followers.\nDoes Facebook think it knows better than the 6 million people who clicked like on our page?\nWe also had close to 16,000 reviews on our page with an average 4.1 star rating, directly showing that people desired to see what we were putting out.\nThe only ones manipulating people here are the tech giants themselves.\nAll but proving the case that this was a coordinated attack by the tech giant community, shortly after the purge on Facebook, Twitter followed suit, wiping out our profiles on there as well.\nThey gave absolutely no reason for the suspension.\n“This signifies a re-consolidation of the media.\nCable news media controlled the narrative for most of modern history, but the internet has lowered that barrier to entry and allowed the average person to become the media themselves.\nThis obviously took market share and influence away from the traditional media, and it has allowed for a more diverse public conversation.\nNow it seems the platforms that have monopolized the industry are favoring mainstream sources and silencing alternative voices.\nSo now, instead of allowing more people to have a voice, these platforms are creating an atmosphere where only powerful media organizations are welcome, just as we had on cable news,” John Vibes poignantly noted.\nThe bottom line is that sites like ours and the others who were wiped from the internet yesterday represent a voice against the plutocratic information-controlling establishment.\nWe challenge their paradigm of control and this is a thorn in their side.\nThere are no longer distinct lines between social media giants and government either which renders the “they are private, they can do what they wish” argument moot.\nFacebook has been partnering with the Digital Forensics Lab, an arm of the Atlantic Council think tank — a neoconservative group funded by Gulf monarchies, defense giants like Raytheon, megabanks like HSBC, foreign state actors, and the US government — to weed out people like us who challenge the status quo.\nThe entity that is making censorship decisions for Facebook, as publicly announced, is the Atlantic Council, a partly US government-funded entity.\nAt what point will the extremely tight ties between these companies and the US government end the \"they are private\" argument?\n— Daniel McAdams (@DanielLMcAdams) October 12, 2018\nServing as a kick in the teeth to the thousands of people who lost their livelihoods yesterday because of this purge is the fact that pages who do set out to deliberately deceive people, put out actual fake news, and slander others — like the infamous Your News Wire — remain intact and able to post.\nNo, we are not calling for these fake pages to be removed, but instead using it as a point of reference as to why they targeted us when pages like YNW have become famous for spreading lies and deceiving people.\nThose who demanded Facebook & other Silicon Valley giants censor political content - something they didn't actually want to do - are finding that content that they themselves support & like end up being repressed.\nThat's what has happened to every censorship advocate in history: https://t.co/IZHF8GVkgC — Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) October 12, 2018\nIndeed, we have reached the precipice of corporate-state censorship.\nThose who have constantly demanded that tech giants silence their critics and information that ‘offends’ them are finally seeing the inevitable results of such irresponsible acts.\nAs we have been pointing out for the last two years, tech monopolies large enough to silence those with whom you disagree, are large enough to one day silence you.\nThe silver lining to this massive purge of independent media is that it signals the beginning of the end of censored media.\nTFTP has been planning for this day and we have been growing our email list and our subscriber base.\nWe will not be silenced.\nWhile it may seem bleak for now, we will rise from the ashes of the social media dinosaurs to help build and create new platforms that are out of their control where ideas of peace and freedom can be discussed openly without fear of devoting years to a platform that can disappear you in the blink of an eye.\nIf you are not on our email list, please sign up here.\nIf you’d like to subscribe to our site to aid in the battle against the censors and receive special perks along the way, you can do so at this link.\nWe are also working with the folks from minds.com and have created a platform on their uncensored network as well.\nYou can follow us at this link.\nWe have been on Steemit as well.\nAnd Instagram too.\nArticle posted with permission from The Free Thought Project\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":

Wilders spoke at a massive rally for Tommy Robinson on Saturday.\n20,000 people came out to call for Tommy’s release, and Wilders took the opportunity to put the political elites of Britain and continental Europe on notice.\n“Our governments,” Wilders declared, “sold us out with mass immigration.\nWith Islamization.\nWith open borders.\nWe are almost foreigners in our own lands.\nAnd if we complain about it, they call us racists and Islamophobes.\nBut I say, no more!\nAnd what do you say?\nNo more!\nAnd that’s right: enough is enough.\nWe will not be gagged anymore.\nNo more tyranny.”\nIt was extraordinary that the British authorities allowed Wilders into the country at all.\nSeveral years ago he was banned from entering the country, but although the ban was reversed on appeal, the British government recently banned Martin Sellner, Brittany Pettibone, Lauren Southern and Lutz Bachmann from entering, all for the crime of opposing jihad terror and Sharia oppression, and thereby made it clear that it is more authoritarian and unwilling to uphold the freedom of speech than ever – at least when it comes to criticism of Islam, Muslim rape gangs, and mass Muslim migration.\nEven worse, the bannings of Sellner, Pettibone, Southern, and Bachmann were just part of a long pattern.\nPamela Geller and I were banned from entering Britain in 2013, apparently for life, also for the crime of telling the truth about Islam and jihad.\nMeanwhile, Britain has a steadily lengthening record of admitting jihad preachers without a moment of hesitation.\nSyed Muzaffar Shah Qadri’s preaching of hatred and jihad violence was so hardline that he was banned from preaching in Pakistan, but the UK Home Office welcomed him into Britain.\nThe UK Home Office also admitted Shaykh Hamza Sodagar into the country, despite the fact that he has said: “If there’s homosexual men, the punishment is one of five things.\nOne – the easiest one maybe – chop their head off, that’s the easiest.\nSecond – burn them to death.\nThird – throw ’em off a cliff.\nFourth – tear down a wall on them so they die under that.\nFifth – a combination of the above.”\nTheresa May’s relentlessly appeasement-minded government also admitted two jihad preachers who had praised the murderer of a foe of Pakistan’s blasphemy laws.\nOne of them was welcomed by the Archbishop of Canterbury.\nMeanwhile, the UK banned three bishops from areas of Iraq and Syria where Christians are persecuted from entering the country.\nBut now matters are coming to a head.\nApparently British authorities decided that it would be too politically costly for them to bar Wilders again.\nAnd so he entered, and spoke, and gave them a strong dose of the reality that they are determined to ignore and deny.\nTommy Robinson is in prison today because he violated a court order demanding that he not film videos outside the trials of Muslim rape gangs.\nClearly the government’s intent was to make sure that as few people as possible discovered the truth about its massive, years-long cover-up of those rape gangs, and refusal to prosecute the perpetrators.\nTheresa May and company obvious hope that other Britons who are furious about the sacrifice of thousands of British girls to the idols of “diversity” and “multiculturalism” will see what happened to Tommy, and be frightened into silence.\nThe British government, in imprisoning Tommy Robinson, has shown itself willing to incarcerate people for having opinions that it considers unacceptable.\nThat heralds the death of Britain as a free society and the beginning of an authoritarian police state there, unless this slide to totalitarianism is stopped now.\nBritish public figures, whatever criticism they have leveled against Tommy Robinson in the past, should be calling for him to be freed today, or else they will be exposing themselves as supporting the degeneration of Britain into a police state.\nWilders addressed this endeavor head-on, declaring: “We will not be silenced.\nWe will not be intimidated.\nAnd we tell the governments, we are not afraid of you.\nWe will never surrender.\nWe will stand strong and do our duty.\nWe will defend our civilization.\nAnd we will protect our people.”\nWilders added: “And I tell you, to the governments.\nYou can throw us in jail, but you will never defeat us.\nBecause, my friends, for every Tommy whom you imprison, thousands will rise up.\nSo take notice, Theresa May.\nTake notice, Dutch Prime Minister Rutte.\nTake notice, Mrs. Merkel or President Macron.\nTake notice: the future is ours and not yours.\nWe will defeat you politically, because we, my friends, we are the people.”\nIf Wilders’ words don’t prove true, it will be because the death of free societies in Britain and Western Europe is truly at hand.\n[Photo by Jan Kranendonk]\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":

Лучше рано. Или даже прямо сейчас. Лучше для жителей Горловки, Зайцево, Железной балки, Донецка, которые 8!!! лет прячут детей в подвалах от украинских снарядов. Лучше для простых киевлян и харьковчан, которые ночь провели в метро. Лучше для нас всех. Гражданских и военных. Никто не хочет войны. На войне умирают и страдают люди. Только представьте, дети, которые родились под обстрелами, уже пошли в школу. Под обстрелами. Сегодня украинские военные убили ещё двух учителей, ещё одна ранена. Прямое попадание снаряда в школу. Мне кажется, наши горячие головы, которые требуют капитуляции ошибаются в целеполагании. Зачем она нужна и кому? Для самоутверждения? Киев и Харьков были и останутся украинскими, и никто на них не покушается. Главное — прекратить многолетнее кровопролитие в Европе. Больше это невозможно терпеть. Я знаю, о чем говорю. Я видел своими глазами, как рвались снаряды у больницы, где находились нетранспортабельные пациенты хосписа. Кто-нибудь, в здравом уме, объясните, зачем бомбить хоспис? А школу? Многоэтажки? Всё это можно остановить прямо сейчас. Для этого требуется воля. Не только Киева, но и Брюсселя. Полное прекращение  огня и гарантии полной безопасности . Для Донбасса, для Киева, для Москвы, Парижа и Берлина. Очень надеюсь, что эта воля осталась у тех, кто принимает решения. Для нас же сейчас главное — быть едиными . Не поддаваться эмоциям, быть сдержанными и корректными. Заниматься своим делом. Помогать беженцам. Держать кулаки за наших военных.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 13, 2018\nThe Washington Post first reported on the story prior to Trump’s tweet.\nTrump and Tillerson have had a fraught relationship for many months.\nTrump told reporters Tuesday that he ultimately decided to fire the secretary because they disagreed over strategy in key areas of foreign policy, such as the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, the approach to North Korea and the overall tone of U.S. diplomacy.\nTillerson said he received a call from Trump around noon Tuesday, more than three hours after his firing was first reported by The Washington Post and announced minutes later in a tweet from the president.\nHis voice quivering, Tillerson thanked career diplomats for their “honesty and integrity” and the American people for “acts of kindness,” and he singled out Defense Secretary Jim Mattis for their partnership and mutual support of diplomacy.\nBut he notably did not thank Trump or praise his policies.\nTillerson said he will remain in his post until March 31 but is delegating all authorities for running the State Department to Deputy Secretary John Sullivan and is committed to ensuring “an orderly and smooth transition.” The deposed diplomat also made a clear statement about Russian aggression: “Much work remains to respond to the troubling behavior and actions on the part of the Russian government.”\n﻿\nCNBC reports that Tillerson was not the only firing that took place on Tuesday:\nOn Tuesday morning, State Department spokesman Steve Goldstein said Tillerson had no plans to leave.\nHe “did not speak to the president this morning and is unaware of the reason” for his firing, the spokesman added.\nTwo White House officials told the Associated Press that Tillerson found out he was fired Friday.\nThe secretary got a call from White House chief of staff John Kelly but only got told an unspecified presidential tweet concerning him may be coming, officials at the State Department told the wire service.\nLater, the White House fired Goldstein, who contradicted the administration’s account of Tillerson’s ouster, according to NBC News and the AP.\nGoldstein was the under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs.\nTrump later told reporters he disagreed with Tillerson on some issues and feels the diplomat “will be much happier now.”\nWhile many are happy that Tillerson is gone, many of us are concerned with Mike Pompeo being installed at Secretary of State, especially regarding his un-American comments against NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, who exposed the criminal activity of the Deep State in DC.\nSpeaking of Snowden, he decided to chime in on the newly appointed CIA director, but did not say anything about Pompeo becoming Secretary of State.\n“The new CIA director was a key part of the torture program and its illegal cover-up.\nHer name was on the Top Secret order demanding the destruction of tapes to prevent them being seen by Congress.\nIncredible.” Snowden tweeted.\nThe

Arabian Gulf\n\nYesterday’s State of the Union address issued by Donald Trump represented a refreshing break from the eight years of pusillanimous foreign policies pursued by past administration.\nNowhere was this more evident than in the manner in which Trump described Iran’s repressive regime and attempts by the Iranian people to overthrow it through peaceful protest.\nWhen it comes to Iran’s governing authorities, the Trump administration is under no illusions about the nefarious nature of this fascist theocracy.\n“We are restoring clarity about our adversaries,” Trump stated in a not too subtle jibe at his predecessor who seemed to be in a perpetual state of confusion about who his friends and enemies were.\nTrump also referenced the recent widespread Iranian protests, crushed with extreme ruthlessness by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and its Basij auxiliary militia.\n“When the people of Iran rose up against the crimes of a corrupt dictatorship,” he stated, “I did not stay silent.\nAmerica stands with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom.”\nBy contrast, Barack Obama and his obsequious acolytes were besotted by the prospect of forging détente with the despotic mullahs of the Islamic Republic.\nHis administration remained largely silent when Iranians took to the streets in 2009 to protest a rigged election.\nSome have speculated that his administration missed out on a prime opportunity for regime change.\nIt was only downhill from there.\nIn a misguided effort to secure Iran’s willingness to sign the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, Obama sold everything including the kitchen sink.\nHe tried selling the American people on the naïve notion that there were moderate elements of import in the Iranian government, ignoring the obvious fact that all authority in Iran is vested with the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, and his IRGC henchmen.\nThe tried and true concept of peace through strength gave way to fecklessness through appeasement.\nRansom payments to the tune of $1.7 billion were transferred to Iran.\nPromising criminal investigations targeting Iran’s chief terror proxy, Hezbollah, were shut down.\nTargeted liquidation operations by our Israeli allies against Iranian Quds Force leaders were foiled after Obama tipped off Tehran on Israel’s intentions.\nIranian material breaches of the JCPOA were all but ignored while Iran’s ballistic missile program was allowed to proceed at full speed despite being in defiance of United Nations Security Council resolution 2231.\nObama’s near messianic zealotry in his interactions with the mullahs severely compromised America’s national security and weakened its image on the international stage.\nWorse, it emboldened the mullahs (appeasement tends to do that) who seemed to revel in Obama’s groveling.\nIran’s mischief-making extends far and wide but it is in the Arabian Gulf where friction between the IRGC and the United States Navy remains constant.\nIran regards the Arabian Gulf as its domain and but for the presence of the U.S. 5th Fleet, would have full reign over its waters, which include the strategic Strait of Hormuz.\nIn addition to securing the Gulf, the 5th Fleet serves as a constant reminder to the Iranians of their impotence.\nBut the deterrent effect of the Navy’s 5th Fleet, and for that matter America’s military might, is only as effective as the political leadership that commands it, and Barack Obama as Commander in Chief of the armed forces did little to instill fear or project deterrence.\nOn the contrary, the Iranians correctly viewed him as weak, indecisive and ineffectual.\nOn his watch, American warships patrolling the Gulf were harried by armed IRGC speed boats and larger navy frigates with near impunity.\nAt times Iranian naval vessels closed to within 600 to 150 yards of American warships.\nThe navy termed these near ritualistic, belligerent encounters, “unsafe and unprofessional.”\nIranian arrogance and impudence reached its zenith with the January 12th 2016 seizure of two American riverine command boats and their crews near Farsi Island.\nThe RCBs and crews manning them were returned some 16 hours later but not before the Iranians stole two satellite phone sim cards, likely containing classified information, as well as thousands of pages of information downloaded from laptops, GPS devices and maps used by the sailors.\nIronically, the seizure occurred on the very day that Obama was to give his State of the Union address but predictably, he didn’t think that the seizure of Americans was important enough to note.\nBut according to the Navy, the past five months have witnessed markedly less belligerent conduct from the Iranians, leaving Navy officials baffled by the sudden positive change in attitude.\nIn fact, Iran’s attitude adjustment in the Arabian Gulf is no mystery and stems from the Trump administration’s implementation of a new robust foreign policy vis-à-vis the Islamic Republic.\nSoon after taking office, Trump noted that “Iran [was] playing with fire” and added that he wouldn’t be as “kind” to the mullahs as Obama was.\nThis wasn’t empty rhetoric.\nIt was backed up by tangible action.\nAdditional sanctions were imposed against Iran for acting in defiance of UNSCR 2231.\nSanctions were also imposed against the IRGC for supporting terrorism.\nTrump’s DOJ revived and breathed new life into Project Cassandra, a promising anti-Hezbollah/IRGC law enforcement initiative shelved by Obama.\nMost importantly, Trump failed to certify the JCPOA noting material Iranian breaches, and has threatened to abrogate the deal in its entirety unless modifications are implemented.\nThose modifications would include an end to absurd sunset clauses in the JCPOA and tough restrictions on ballistic missile testing.\nThe mullahs have become cognizant of the fact that there’s a new sheriff in town, one that backs up tough talk

Kelly was nothing but surreal, and honestly, he should be impeached over his frivolous ruling that demanded the White House reinstate CNN reporter Jim Acosta's press pass.\nHowever, the White House has decided to comply, which I wonder just how dangerous a precedent this sets, and as a result, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders has issued a code of conduct for the White House press.\nWe have created these rules with a degree of regret,” Sanders said in a statement.\nThe fact that the White House submitted to such a ridiculous demand when it is simple human decency to conduct one's self in a proper manner, unlike how Jim Acosta treated both Sarah Sanders, President Donald Trump and a White House aide, is a testimony to how little those who represent us know of our Constitution.\ntake our poll - story continues below\nShould Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?\nShould Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?\nShould Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?\n* Yes, he should have gotten it back.\nNo, you can't act like a child and keep your pass.\nMaybe?\nI'm not sure if he should have.\nEmail *\nEmail This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\nCompleting this poll grants you access to Freedom Outpost updates free of charge.\nYou may opt out at anytime.\nYou also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\n“We would have greatly preferred to continue hosting White House press conferences in reliance on a set of understood professional norms, and we believe the overwhelming majority of journalists covering the White House share that preference,” Sanders said.\n“But, given the position taken by CNN, we now feel obligated to replace previously shared practices with explicit rules.”\nOh, but there's more.\nIf journalists can't conduct themselves according to these rules, then there is no other option but to.... write more explicit rules!\nSeriously!\n“At this time, however, we have decided not to frame such rules in the hope that professional journalistic norms will suffice to regulate conduct in those places,” Sanders said.\n“If unprofessional behavior occurs in those settings, or if a court should decide that explicit rules are required to regulate conduct there, we will be forced to reconsider this decision.”\nThe White House should be telling Judge Kelly where he can take his ruling, but they are trying to look like they are on the high ground while submitting to unconstitutional rulings from a federal judge who should know better.\nHowever, here are the new rules released by the White House Press Office.\n(1) A journalist called upon to ask a question will ask a single question and then will yield the floor to other journalists; (2) At the discretion of the President or other White House official taking questions, a follow-up question or questions may be permitted; and where a follow up has been allowed and asked, the questioner will then yield the floor; (3) “Yielding the floor” includes, when applicable, physically surrendering the microphone to White House staff for use by the next questioner; (4) Failure to abide by any of rules (1)-(3) may result in suspension or revocation of the journalist’s hard pass.\nI can see this going way downhill.\nIf you want to deal with people like Acosta, at the moment they begin to show who and what they really are, stop calling on them for questions.\nThis is my advice to the White House.\nDon't call on Jim Acosta another time for as long as he remains in the White House Press.\nMake him regret it the entire time he is there.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Name_Calling,Labeling\t156\t171\nExaggeration,Minimisation\t199\t218\nLoaded_Language\t433\t442\nFlag-Waving\t963\t979\nLoaded_Language\t2090\t2100\nFlag-Waving\t952\t954\nLoaded_Language\t714\t724\nLoaded_Language\t266\t275\nLoaded_Language\t3386\t3419\n"}]}

Back In Washington DC\n\nAl Franken Is Just The Beginning As The Curtain Is Pulled Back In Washington DC\nPlease help support us with cryptocurrency donations.\nThank you!\nFor decades, Americans have known that very sick things happen behind the scenes in Washington D.C., but the mainstream media nearly really talks about any of it.\nBut now the curtain is starting to be pulled back, and the revelations about Al Franken are just the beginning.\nEarlier this week, I wrote an article about how “sexual harassment is rampant in the halls of Congress”, and that was before a female radio anchor named LeeAnn Tweeden revealed that Al Franken had “forcibly kissed” and groped her during a USO tour in 2006.\nThe following comes from an article in which Tweeden shared her story…\nI couldn’t believe it.\nHe groped me, without my consent, while I was asleep.\nI felt violated all over again.\nEmbarrassed.\nBelittled.\nHumiliated.\nHow dare anyone grab my breasts like this and think it’s funny?\nI told my husband everything that happened and showed him the picture.\nI wanted to shout my story to the world with a megaphone to anyone who would listen, but even as angry as I was, I was worried about the potential backlash and damage going public might have on my career as a broadcaster.\nBut that was then, this is now.\nI’m no longer afraid.\nWhen the story initially broke, Franken rushed to issue an apology…\n“I certainly don’t remember the rehearsal for the skit in the same way, but I send my sincerest apologies to Leeann,” said Franken.\n“As to the photo, it was clearly intended to be funny but wasn’t.\nI shouldn’t have done it.”\nNeedless to say, many were completely unsatisfied with Franken’s very weak statement.\nIn fact, some members of his own party said that his apology was entirely insufficient and are calling for Franken to be held accountable for his actions…\nGuy Cecil, the former head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and now the boss of a leading Democratic super PAC, voiced his frustration with the inadequacy of Franken’s apology on Twitter.\n“That was not an apology and was an insufficient response to serious allegations,” Cecil tweeted.\n“Al Franken must be held accountable if our party wants to live up to our commitment to women & girls.”\nThis scandal has set off a feeding frenzy as Internet sleuths search for other incidents in which Franken has acted inappropriately.\nAnd of course, since we are talking about Al Franken, it wasn’t exactly difficult to find material.\nFor example, a photo has surfaced of Franken grabbing Joy Behar in a very creepy manner.\nThe following comes from Breitbart…\nAmid the emergence of a 2006 photo of Al Franken groping journalist and talk radio anchor Leeann Tweeden, a photo of the embattled Minnesota Senator appearing to grab comedian Joy Behar’s breast has also resurfaced.\nFranken was a comedian before he ever entered the world of politics, and we understand that.\nBut just because he was a comedian does not mean that he gets to play by a different set of rules.\nThere appears to be an ongoing pattern of behavior, and Fox News has documented some of the other incidents that have come up in the past…\nFranken, then a comedian, was quoted in a 1995 New York Magazine article discussing a skit for “Saturday Night Live” that involved drugging and raping CBS reporter Lesley Stahl.\nFranken, at the time a writer for “SNL,” suggested one skit should play out with “60 Minutes” commentator Andy Rooney finding an empty pill bottle on his desk.\n“’I give the pills to Lesley Stahl.\nThen when Lesley is passed out, I take her to the closet and rape her.’ Or ‘That’s why you never see Lesley until February.’ Or, ‘When she passes out.\nI put her in various positions and take pictures of her,’” Franken was quoted saying.\nThe article, along with a 2000 Playboy column in which Franken talked about fantasizing a machine would perform oral sex on him, was used to attack Franken during his 2008 Senate campaign in Minnesota.\nAs much as we may be appalled by some of the things that Al Franken has done, the truth is that there are far worse offenders in Washington.\nLet’s talk about Bill Clinton for a moment.\nDemocrats have been covering up his sexual crimes for years, and my hope is that now this will start to change.\nJuanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey, Connie Hamzy, Eileen Wellstone, Sandra Allen James, Christy Zercher, Paula Jones, Monica Lewinsky, Gennifer Flowers, Elizabeth Ward Gracen, Sally Perdue, Lencola Sullivan, Susie Whitacre and Bobbie Ann William are some of the women that have made allegations against Clinton, and if even half of their allegations are true Clinton should be in prison for the rest of his life.\nIn my article yesterday, I discussed how one Secret Service agent is charging former Vice-President Joe Biden of engaging in “Weinstein-level” behavior, and I also talked about how 15 million dollars in settlements have been secretly paid out to victims of sexual harassment in the House of Representatives in recent years.\nThere is a culture of corruption in Washington D.C., and we desperately need to drain the swamp.\nIf you agree, I hope that you will support my campaign and the campaigns of other anti-establishment candidates that want to clean up the halls of Congress.\nIt is time to take our government back because at this point it has become an absolutely disgusting cesspool of filth and corruption.\nArticle posted with permission from End of the American Dream\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant",

Keith Ellison because the lawmaker’s ex-girlfriend refused to provide video of the incident - but the findings are still being turned over to law enforcement.\n\nThe Associated Press on Monday reported that it obtained a draft of a report written by Susan Ellingstad, a lawyer hired by Minnesota's Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party to investigate the claim against Ellison.\n\n\n\"The investigation report, which was released today without our knowledge by someone outside of our organization, was unable to substantiate the claim of physical abuse made by Ms. Monahan,” DFL Chairman Ken Martin said in a statement.\n\nMartin said they planned to turn over the report to local law enforcement.\n\n“For the purpose of objectivity and getting all of the facts regarding these allegations, we have decided to forward the information in the investigation to local authorities in order to let them review the contents and determine whether further investigation is warranted,” Martin said.\nThe Democratic congressman, who serves as deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee, has denied the allegations.\n\nIn a statement, Ellison thanked Ellingstad for conducting a \"thorough, independent, and fair review.\"\n\n\"I believe women who come forward must be heard, and to have their allegations fully investigated,\" Ellison said.\n\"This is why I have complied with this investigation fully, and will do so with any other inquiries.\n... At this time, I will be focusing on the issues of this important election.\"\n\nEllison’s ex-girlfriend, Karen Monahan, alleged in August that Ellison dragged her off a bed by her feet while screaming obscenities at her in 2016.\nMonahan said she had video footage of the incident and levied the allegation just days ahead of a crowded Democratic primary for Minnesota attorney general that Ellison went on to win.\n\nThe state's Democratic party launched an investigation into the claim, retaining a local attorney with links to the state party to determine whether the alleged incident took place.\nDemocratic party chairman Ken Martin said last week he expected the investigation to conclude soon.\n\nA draft report obtained by the AP noted Monahan's shifting rationale for refusing to produce the video footage, including that it was lost, was on a USB drive in storage and would be too embarrassing and traumatic to release it.\n\nThe Ellison accusations have put Democrats in an uncomfortable position, as they speak out on sexual misconduct claims against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.\nKavanaugh denies the accusations.\n\nMonahan slammed the Democratic Party for its response to her allegations when compared to its treatment of Christine Blasey Ford.\nFord has accused Kavanaugh of attempting to force himself onto her during a high school party nearly four decades ago.\nMany prominent Democrats have supported Ford’s allegations.\n\n“No, they don't,” Monahan tweeted in response to a question of whether the party believes women’s stories.\n“I've been smeared, threatened, isolated from my own party.\nI provided medical records from 2017, stating on two different Dr.\nVisits, I told them about the abuse and who did it.\nMy therapist released records stating I have been dealing and healing from the abuse.”\n\nShe added: “Four people, including my supervisor at the time, stated that I came to them after and shared the exact story I shared publicly, I shared multiple text between me and Keith, where I discuss the abuse with him and much more.\nAs I said before, I knew I wouldn't be believed.”\nMany other Democrats and progressives – who largely stayed silent after the accusations against Ellison emerged – came out in support of Ford, including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Tom Perez, chairman of the DNC, who urged to investigate the claims and Kavanaugh.\n\nMonahan went to reiterate that her story has nothing to do with politics.\n“I have nothing to prove to anyone, I simply shared my story.\nPeople can believe it or not.\nI don’t need anyone to affirm my humanity, I affirmed it,” she wrote in another tweet.\n\n“The fact that both parties only care if it scores political points is hypocritical,” she added.\n“Do you think a person who has dealt with any form of abuse by politicians is thinking about politics?\nNo, we & are families are trying to heal.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Loaded_Language\t4321\t4334\n"}]}

Военная операция по принуждению Украины к миру продолжается всего два дня, но ощущение, что не Русские войска сейчас штурмуют Киев и Харьков, а украинские Белгород или Шебекино. Ещё раз повторяю - повода нет даже для беспокойства, не говоря уже про панику. Ситуация находится под жёстким контролем военных Российской Армии. Панические сообщения среди населения России распространяются специальными подразделениями Центра Информационно - психологических операций Украины, которые курируются Американской и Британской разведками. Так например в течении сегодняшнего дня неоднократно появлялась в сети интернет информация о том, что в г. Сочи готовится морской десант Военно Морских сил Украины. Отвечаю. Украинский флот прекратил свое существование в первые 5 часов начала боевых действий. Всё корабли ВМС Украины были либо уничтожены крылатыми ракетами \"Калибр\", либо заблокированы в местах базирования. Так же сотрудниками Западных и Украинских спецслужб сегодня распространяются в Российских группах в социальных сетях ВК, Ок, ФБ, мессенджерах Телеграм, Ватцап, Вайбер не соответствующие действительности данные, о якобы прорыве Украинских вооружённых сил на территорию России. Наши войска сейчас ведут успешную военную операцию на Украине. Уже сегодня начались бои в кварталах города Киева! Завершается окружение таких городов как Одесса, Мариуполь, Харьков, Николаев, Херсона и ряда других. Украинской армии нанесён сокрушителтный удар современными видами вооружения. В первые 5 часов начала боевых действий была уничтожена практически вся авиация, разбомблены все аэродромы, уничтожены средства ПВО. Так же уничтожены на аэродромах базирования 15 беспилотных летательных аппарата Байрактар. Вооружённые Силы Украины в ближайшее время прекратят свое существование. В Киеве и ряде других крупных городах Украины, власти начали безучетно раздавать гражданам оружие, что говорит о критической ситуации и панике. Поэтому повторю ещё раз - не ведитесь на информационные вбросы спецслужб наших противников, которые направлены на дестабилизацию обстановки в России. Всех кто распространяет панические слухи осекайте. Не ведитесь на призывы выходить на митинги и пикеты \"Нет войне\", которые сейчас массово тиражируются украинскими спецслужбами. Они не имеют ничего общего с истиными целями, а раскачиваются лишь для того, чтобы оказать давление на военно - политическое руководство России. Считаю в сложившейся военной обстановке это предательством национальных интересов России, а всех вышедших на эти акции искусственного протеста предателями России.

Dept Rules Imply Otherwise\n\nDallas, TX — As citizens call for justice in the case of Dallas police officer Amber Guyger — the cop who killed the innocent Botham Jean in his own home — the controversy continues to grow.\nIn a town hall meeting this week, citizens showed that they still have a lot of questions for the Dallas Police Department in regards to the cold-blooded killing of Botham Jean.\nOn top of questions as to why it took several days to arrest the cop — despite the fact that Guyger admitted to it — were questions like why this person who has proven to be a threat to society has yet to be fired from the police force.\nDuring the meeting, as Chief Renee Hall dodged several questions over the details of the arrest, she did go out of her way to answer the question of why Guyger is still collecting a paycheck from their department.\nThe short of it, according to Hall, is she can’t fire her.\ntake our poll -

Закончил университет в Синдее, Австралия. Надеюсь скоро наконец вернуться домой, так как учиться успешно закогчил. Заранее прошу прошения за ошибки в тексте, русский язык я долго не учил. Общаясь напрямую с австралийцами и другими иностранцами могу рассказать о полной неосведомлённости о ситуации вокруг Донбасса и Украины в целом. Не знают даже что Майдан вообще был, не знают про Донбасс, Мисике соглашения и историю. Не знают в общем почти ничего. Разговаривал с друзьями из Германии, США, Шотландии, Индии. С бывшими сокурсниками со всего мира и коллегами на работе. Агрессии с их стороны я не встречал, но они проявляют интерес и я всё подробно раасказываю и что важно (!) Наглядно показываю по роликам с Донбасса. После прояснения ситуации, с той стороны с которой её видит Россия, в 90% случаев слышу \"Вау, мы ничего этого не знали\" и \"Ваши действия мы понимаем\". Тоже самое касается и мнения западной аудитории в интернете. Тут уже писали про Реддит, Твиттер и так далее. Я думаю это хорошо показывает как население Запада плохо осведомлено в вопросе и как западные медиа своими лозунгами забили людям голову. Они не они \"тупые\". Это няглядный пример того как работает пропаганда и СМИ. Важно доносить наше мнение в информационной войне. Которую мы проигрываем даже у себя дома, не то что за границей. Хотел бы выразить благодарность Рыбарю за их работу и поддержать военнослужащих ЛДНР и РФ, а так же пожелать всего наилучшено мирным жителям Украины! Надеюсь кто-то из них это увидит. #Россия  #Украина @rybar"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Exaggeration,Minimisation\t882\t931\nAppeal_to_Authority\t985\t1022\nCausal_Oversimplification\t1230\t1285\nExaggeration,Minimisation\t424\t510\nObfuscation,Intentional_Vagueness,Confusion\t812\t878\nObfuscation,Intentional_Vagueness,Confusion\t935\t960\nExaggeration,Minimisation\t512\t541\nExaggeration,Minimisation\t1102\t1150\nObfuscation,Intentional_Vagueness,Confusion\t770\t810\nLoaded_Language\t1456\t1486\nExaggeration,Minimisation\t335\t414\nExaggeration,Minimisation\t1157\t1208\n"}]}

Jackie Speier (D-CA) told MSNBC’s Chuck Todd on Meet the Press Daily on Tuesday that the U.S. House of Representatives has paid $15 million to alleged victims of sexual harassment by its own members in recent years.\n“We do know there is about $15 million that has been paid out by the House on behalf of harassers in the last ten to 15 years,” she said.\n“15 million dollars has been paid out over sexual harassment claims,” Todd replied, somewhat shocked.\n“So, obviously more than one member of Congress.”\nIf members of Congress are engaged in this type of behavior, why don’t the American people know about it?\nAnd why are those members of Congress still allowed to serve?\nRepresentative Barbara Comstock also testified on Tuesday.\nShe said that one current member of Congress exposed his private parts to a female staffer when she delivered papers to his house…\nRep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.) said at a House Administration Committee hearing on Tuesday that a sitting member of the U.S. Congress exposed himself to a young female staffer who delivered papers to his house–at his request.\nWe need to be told who this member of Congress is so that he can be removed from Congress immediately.\nThis kind of behavior is not acceptable for anyone in a civilized society – and that goes double for someone that is supposed to be one of the leaders of our nation.\nHere are the exact words that Comstock used as she described this incident…\nThis member asked a staffer to bring them over some materials, to their residence.\nAnd the young staffer — it was a young woman — went there and was greeted with a member in a towel.\nIt was a male, who then invited her in.\nAnd at that point, he decided to expose himself.\nShe left, and then she quit her job.\nShe left, she found another job.\nOf course, this sort of behavior is not just limited to members of Congress.\nAccording to an ex-Secret Service agent, Vice-President Joe Biden was regularly engaged in “Weinstein-level” predatory behavior…\nAn ex-Secret Service agent is claiming that former Vice President Joe Biden engaged in “Weinstein-level” sexual assault and that he would walk around the VP residence late at night completely naked.\nAccording to Big League Politics’ Cassandra Fairbanks, a Secret Service agent who spoke on condition of anonymity revealed that Biden “would mess with every single woman or teen,” and that a Christmas get-together at the VP’s house had to be canceled “because Biden would grope all of our wives and girlfriend’s asses.”\nIn fact, things were so bad that at one point a Secret Service agent almost got into a fight with Biden.\nHere is more from Paul Joseph Watson…\nDuring one alleged incident in 2009, Biden cupped the breast of a Secret Service agent’s girlfriend during a photo, prompting the agent to shove Biden and almost hit him.\nThe agent was subsequently suspended for a week, according to the source.\nMen would often stand in front of female agents and Navy women or create false pretenses to have them leave the room just to get them away from Biden, according to the agent.\nWhen I am elected to Congress, I am going to make fighting this sort of predatory behavior a top priority.\nWe are supposed to serve as an example to the rest of the world, and instead, we have become a bad joke.\nThose that have been engaging in this sort of shameful behavior have got to go because we simply are not going to put up with it anymore.\nArticle posted with permission from End of the American Dream\nTake a look at the future of America: The Beginning of the End and then prepare.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Loaded_Language\t2312\t2360\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice\t351\t497\nExaggeration,Minimisation\t5035\t5079\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice\t5995\t6133\nRepetition\t4462\t4493\nFlag-Waving\t3987\t4077\nName_Calling,Labeling\t662\t688\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice\t1723\t1821\nLoaded_Language\t5983\t5993\nSlogans\t1629\t1656\nFlag-Waving\t5890\t5994\nLoaded_Language\t259\t277\nName_Calling,Labeling\t4664\t4699\nLoaded_Language\t2249\t2274\nLoaded_Language\t698\t737\nLoaded_Language\t2207\t2240\nFlag-Waving\t614\t735\nExaggeration,Minimisation\t5166\t5219\nLoaded_Language\t5166\t5220\nFlag-Waving\t1657\t1723\nLoaded_Language\t563\t580\nLoaded_Language\t3497\t3542\nLoaded_Language\t4882\t4899\nName_Calling,Labeling\t4789\t4821\nLoaded_Language\t1306\t1337\n"}]}

Curtis IV, the author of “Black Muslim Religion in the Nation of Islam,” said that while estimates ranged wildly about how many bona fide members belonged to the Nation, he believes that there were tens of thousands of members in the 1960s and early 1970s.\nBut he said that millions of others sympathized with the movement’s anticolonial stance and were inspired by its most famous member, Muhammad Ali.\n\nWho is Louis Farrakhan?\nBorn Louis Eugene Walcott in New York in 1933, Mr. Farrakhan joined the Nation of Islam in the mid-1950s and rose quickly within the organization, becoming close to Malcolm X.\nAfter the assassination of Malcolm X in 1965, he became one of the most powerful members of the Nation and its chief spokesman, the position that Malcolm X had held.\n\nThe Nation of Islam had gained followers around the nation in the 1940s and ’50s by providing something of a religious answer to antiblack racism.\nIt was not widely recognized as an anti-Jewish organization during its early years (its early literature, though, focused on “the white man” as “the white devil”).\nBut in 1967, it became outspokenly and flagrantly anti-Zionist, in an expression of solidarity with Palestinians.\nThat political position became a vehicle for Mr. Farrakhan to express his anti-Semitism.\n(Among his more infamous comments is his 1984 description of Adolf Hitler as “a very great man.”)\n\nIn 1975, when Elijah Muhammad died, the Nation split into two factions.\nThe faction reconstituted under Mr. Farrakhan in the late 1970s retained the original name, though not the influence or support that it had when its leaders were Malcolm X, Muhammad Ali and Elijah Muhammad.\nMr. Curtis said that today the membership could be in the thousands, and there could even be as many as 10,000 followers.\nMr. Farrakhan, whose name, the Anti-Defamation League wrote after the February event, is “virtually synonymous with anti-Semitism,” then drew national attention in 1984, when he exhorted his followers to support Jesse Jackson’s bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nIn a radio address, he urged listeners to “make an example” of a Washington Post reporter who had reported that Mr. Jackson had used anti-Semitic terms in private.\nMr. Jackson repudiated Mr. Farrakhan, but the minister’s support proved troublesome to his 1988 campaign as well.\n\nHe was back in the news in 1995 when he organized what became known as the “Million Man March,” a political and religious revival event in Washington.\n\nWhy were Tamika Mallory and Danny Davis reluctant to denounce him?\nMs. Mallory, who declined to comment for this article, did not respond to calls to condemn Mr. Farrakhan, for whom she had expressed admiration in the past.\n\nOn March 3, she said on Twitter that someone had brought to her attention that she had yet to tweet “my absolute position on how wrong anti-Semitism is.” A day later, she said that she was “committed to ending anti-black racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia & transphobia,” but did not mention Mr. Farrakhan.\n\nIn an essay posted Wednesday, she said that she had been attending Saviour’s Day celebrations for over 30 years.\n\n“In that most difficult period of my life, it was the women of the Nation of Islam who supported me and I have always held them close to my heart for that reason,” she said.\nThe essay did not mention Mr. Farrakhan.\nAsked what the appeal of Mr. Farrakhan’s views might be to people like Ms. Mallory, religious scholars emphasized that the Nation of Islam is a religion and can provide comfort and aid to its adherents.\n\n“For those who find it appealing, it is a form of radical black self love that is willing to challenge any potential impediment to black freedom,” Mr. Curtis said.\n\nYvonne Chireau, a professor of religion at Swarthmore who called Mr. Farrakhan’s remarks about Jews “unbelievably vile,” emphasized that his fundamentalism was comparable to the fundamentalist views found in other religions.\n\nCoincidentally, the photo of Mr. Farrakhan and Mr. Obama had been published by the Trice Edney News Wire in January.\nThe News Wire reported that the picture had been taken by the photojournalist Askia Muhammad during a 2005 meeting of the Congressional Black Caucus and that Mr. Muhammad kept the photo under wraps so as not to hurt Mr. Obama’s candidacy.\n\n(Mr. Muhammad, in a 2012 blog post, said that he was an admirer of Mr. Farrakhan and that the minister was not an anti-Semite.\nHe reaffirmed that he admired Mr. Farrakhan in an interview on Friday, though he said that the things the minister says about Jewish people “sometimes make me shudder.”)\n\nKatie Hill, a spokeswoman for Mr. Obama, said on Friday: “President Obama has denounced racism and anti-Semitism his entire life.\nThat includes his public and repeated repudiations of Louis Farrakhan’s views over the years.\nToday is no different — he still rejects the harmful and divisive views Farrakhan continues to espouse.”\n\nRepresentative Davis, who was interviewed by The Daily Caller, a conservative news site, after the photo emerged, called Mr. Farrakhan an “outstanding human being,” and later said he was not bothered by the leader’s position on “The Jewish Question.”\n\nAfter a monthlong backlash about that interview, largely in conservative media, Mr. Davis said in a statement to Forward on Thursday that “I reject, condemn and oppose Minister Farrakhan’s views and remarks regarding the Jewish people and the Jewish religion.”\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":

House\n\nJim Acosta has his press pass back.\n\nThe Trump administration stood down on Monday from its nearly two-week-long dispute with CNN over the White House credentials of Mr. Acosta, informing the correspondent that his badge was formally restored.\nCNN in turn dropped its lawsuit on the matter, which had ballooned into a test of press freedoms in the Trump era.\n\nBut while it yielded to Mr. Acosta — whose testy questions had touched off Mr. Trump’s ire — the administration used the occasion to lay down a set of formal rules governing reporters’ behavior at future White House news conferences, a highly unusual step.\n\nAmong the guidelines was a restriction of one question per reporter, with follow-ups allowed at the discretion of the president or the White House official at the lectern.\n“Failure to abide,” the administration warned, “may result in suspension or revocation of the journalist’s hard pass.”\n\nThe White House sought to blame Mr. Acosta for behaving disrespectfully, although Mr. Trump often lobs insults at journalists and encourages a free-for-all format when taking questions from reporters.\nCodifying the behavior of journalists struck some as an ominous encroachment into freedom of the press, and the White House Correspondents’ Association said on Monday that it had not been consulted about the new guidelines.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, in a statement, said: “These rules give the White House far too much discretion to avoid real scrutiny.\nThe White House belongs to the public, not the president, and the job of the press is to ask hard questions, not to be polite company.”\nStill, the guidelines are not far removed from the manner in which White House news conferences typically proceed.\nMr. Trump made clear last week that he would introduce “regulations” after a federal judge criticized the White House for stripping Mr. Acosta’s credentials without due process or a coherent rationale.\n\n“We would have greatly preferred to continue hosting White House press conferences in reliance on a set of understood professional norms, and we believe the overwhelming majority of journalists covering the White House share that preference,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary, said in a statement.\n\nPress relations were not always rosy in pre-Trump days.\nPresident Barack Obama’s aides preselected the news outlets that were allowed to ask questions at his news conferences.\nMr. Obama often chastised reporters, including Mr. Acosta on one occasion, for questions he deemed overly aggressive or grandstanding.\nBut Mr. Trump, a devoted news consumer who relishes his coverage, plays up his conflicts with reporters in part to excite his supporters.\nHe has held far fewer formal news conferences than his predecessors, and the daily White House briefing has virtually disappeared on his watch.\n\nRevoking Mr. Acosta’s White House badge was the most severe step yet, and it soon became apparent that the move would not pass legal muster: After suing last week, Mr. Acosta was granted the temporary return of his credentials by a federal judge.\n\nA back-and-forth ensued over the weekend.\nBill Shine, the deputy chief of staff for communications, sent a letter to Mr. Acosta that listed several reasons that his pass had been revoked, perhaps an attempt to satisfy the judge’s request for a clear rationale.\nCNN’s lawyers called the note an “after-the-fact concocted process.” By Monday afternoon, the sides had reached a resolution.\n\nAides to Mr. Trump say that the president does not mind answering questions, pointing to his numerous impromptu sessions with reporters during White House photo-ops and Marine One departures.\nThe aides complain about reporters who they say do not respect the solemnity of the setting, even as Mr. Trump flouts many of the norms associated with his office.\n\n“The White House’s interaction is, and generally should be, subject to a natural give-and-take,” Ms. Sanders wrote on Monday, suggesting that the onus was on the press corps to ensure that a “code of conduct” did not become necessary.\n\nThat notion read more like a warning — behave or else — and the Correspondents’ Association seemed unmoved.\n\n“For as long as there have been White House press conferences, White House reporters have asked follow-up questions,” the group wrote on Monday.\n“We fully expect this tradition will continue.”\n\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":

Acosta’s press credential\n\nCNN has won the first round of its legal battle to get correspondent Jim Acosta back in the White House.\nU.S. District Court Judge Timothy Kelly granted the cable news network’s request for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction Friday that restored Acosta’s White House press credential.\nKelly ordered that Acosta be reinstated immediately.\nHe did not rule on CNN’s claim that the revocation of the journalist’s pass violated his rights under the First Amendment.\nBut he said the White House did not provide Acosta with due process to legally remove his pass.\nThe ruling followed a court hearing held Wednesday in Washington, where lawyers for CNN and the White House faced off over the issue of press access.\nCNN had the broad support of other news organizations that believed the White House’s actions posed a challenge to press freedom.\n“We are gratified with this result and we look forward to a full resolution in the coming days,” a CNN representative said in a statement.\n“Our sincere thanks to all who have supported not just CNN, but a free, strong and independent American press.”\nThe White House said it would abide by Kelly’s ruling.\n“Today, the court made clear there is no absolute right to access the White House.\nIn response to the court, we will temporarily reinstate the reporter’s hard pass,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement.\n“We will also further develop rules and processes to ensure fair and orderly press conferences in the future.\nThere must be decorum in the White House.”\nAcosta’s press credential was revoked by the White House on Nov. 7 after a testy exchange with President Donald Trump at a White House news conference.\nAt one point, Acosta refused to relinquish the microphone to a White House aide who tried to retrieve it from him.\nIt was the latest in a series of public confrontations between Acosta and Trump, who has repeatedly characterized CNN’s critical coverage of him as “fake news” since the 2016 presidential campaign.\nCNN’s suit filed Tuesday says the suspension of Acosta’s credential violates the First Amendment’s protection of free speech.\nIt also says the way the administration revoked the pass, with no direct notice to Acosta or a written explanation detailing the decision, violated the Fifth Amendment’s protection of due process and the federal Administrative Procedures Act.\n“This severe and unprecedented punishment is the culmination of years of hostility by President Trump against CNN and Acosta based on the contents of their reporting — an unabashed attempt to censor the press and exclude reporters from the White House who challenge and dispute the president’s point of view,” the suit says.\nResponding to the CNN suit, lawyers for the White House said the Trump administration had broad discretion to regulate access to journalists and other members of the public.\n“If the president wants to exclude all reporters from the White House grounds, he has the authority to do that,” Deputy Assistant Attorney General James Burnham said during the hearing.\n“There’s no First Amendment right.”\nThe White House argued that Acosta’s behavior, which it described as rude and aggressive, was the reason for revoking his credential.\nMark Lukasiewicz, dean of The Lawrence Herbert School of Communication at Hofstra University and a former network news executive, praised the judge’s decision, which he said was not a surprise.\n“The White House has lots of other ways to deal with the behavior of reporters if that’s their concern, but closing the gate to a news organization is not one of these ways, and it’s important that the court stood up and said that,” Lukasiewicz said.\n“It’s not the first time a reporter has behaved in a way that a president doesn’t like.”\nLukasiewicz believed CNN would reach a compromise with the White House rather than engage in a prolonged court battle.\n“The law and the Constitution is very clear here,” he said.\nCNN’s suit received the support of more than a dozen news organizations including Fox News, where commentators have often echoed Trump’s criticisms of the network’s coverage.\nRival news organizations came to the defense of Fox News in 2009 when the Obama administration attempted to exclude its reporters from interviews with officials that were offered to all other outlets.\nFox News commentators were President Barack Obama’s harshest critics during his eight years in office, and he often complained about it in public and private.\nBut the press credentials for its conservative-leaning network were never revoked.\nFox News, The Washington Post, NBC News, The Associated Press and the Los Angeles Times are among the entities that have said they will file amicus briefs on behalf of CNN.\n— Stephen Battaglio\nLos Angeles Times\n———\n©2018 Los Angeles Times, Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":

Reneé Hall gave contradictory explanations last week for why she could not fire the officer.\nShe told a town hall that “local, state and federal laws prohibit me from taking action,” according to ABC affiliate WFAA.\n\nTwo days later, the Dallas Morning News reported that police could fire Guyger but did not plan to review her employment until a criminal investigation wrapped up — probably months away.\nIn a statement, Hall said that any disciplinary investigation would risk compromising the criminal case.\n“That is not a risk I am willing to take,” she said.\n\nPolice did not explain what changed by Monday, when the department announced that an internal-affairs investigation had been launched and already “concluded” that Guyger’s arrest was a fireable offense.\nThe officer, who was hired in late 2013, was terminated during a hearing Monday morning “for her actions.”\n\nThe statement notes that Guyger can appeal her firing.\nPolice did not comment on whether Hall is still worried that the termination might affect the criminal investigation.\n\nAs Paul wrote for The Post, the more significant legal questions are whether Guyger is prosecuted as a police officer or civilian and whether a jury decides she acted reasonably in using deadly force.\n\n\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "no propaganda detected"}]}

Federal law gives authority over immigration matters to the executive branch, not the courts.\nChief U.S. District Judge Patti Saris in Boston found she had authority to ensure the Indonesians have a chance to argue that conditions in their home country had deteriorated significantly enough to reopen their cases for trying to stay in the United State.\nShe worried that without the order, ICE officials could deport some of the Indonesians covered by the suit, at which time they would lose the opportunity to have their cases reopened.\n[Judge Orders U.S. To Delay Deporting Indonesians In Immigration Fight, by Scott Malone, Reuters, November 27, 2017]\nKritarch Saris thought she knew better and has been running a deliberate campaign to prevent the deportation of these Chinese illegal aliens.\nAnd now she has gone full rogue, prohibiting the deportation of all these illegal aliens who already had their day in immigration court.Saris appears to be making up immigration law and procedure on the fly, as her order appears to not understand either the EOIR process or immigration law.\n“The government shall inform the court whether petitioners, who are not detained, will have access to emergency procedures if they must file their original motions to reopen,” Saris wrote.\nThis makes no sense in English, much less in the established procedures in the EOIR.\nThe aliens have no emergency, there are no emergency procedures, and their original motions to reopen were denied for lack of legal basis in law or any changed conditions in the country they are being deported to that would avail them of another claim.\nIndonesia is more hospitable to Chinese Christians today than the short period in the 90s when there was a problem.\nBut basically, Saris wants the illegal aliens the opportunity to submit another asylum application, and benefit by the years it will take to adjudicate those claims.\nBasically Saris wants these illegals to never leave.\nThat, of course is not her role.\nThe only claim they have before a Federal court is if they got the due process that Congress gave those illegal aliens.\nAnd they did, they filed for asylum, had a hearing and appeals, and lost.\nWith the legislative fight over DACA, the Trump Administration needs to include legislative language including more restrictions on kritarchs who want to make American immigration policy, as well as other reforms to lower legal immigration, build the wall, and deport illegals here.\nOr impeachment, or both.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Repetition\t3978\t3992\nLoaded_Language\t2320\t2346\nCausal_Oversimplification\t724\t863\nName_Calling,Labeling\t1444\t1453\nRed_Herring\t1936\t2065\nRepetition\t4563\t4570\nLoaded_Language\t1600\t1631\nLoaded_Language\t2910\t2943\nCausal_Oversimplification\t2760\t2844\nRepetition\t4959\t4974\nRepetition\t4068\t4083\nLoaded_Language\t2308\t2315\nName_Calling,Labeling\t1610\t1632\nCausal_Oversimplification\t30\t86\nLoaded_Language\t957\t993\nLoaded_Language\t298\t305\nName_Calling,Labeling\t982\t992\nRepetition\t2308\t2315\nRepetition\t5284\t5299\nLoaded_Language\t4002\t4026\nLoaded_Language\t2050\t2061\nName_Calling,Labeling\t839\t862\nExaggeration,Minimisation\t2231\t2269\nName_Calling,Labeling\t2933\t2941\n"}]}

Weed and they Failed, Miserably\n\nDallas, TX — The Dallas Police on Thursday announced the findings of a search warrant they executed on the home of Botham Jean after he was gunned down in his apartment by one of their own.\nThe department is now accused of trying to “smear” Jean by claiming they found a tiny bit of marijuana in his house—as if this justifies going into someone’s home and murdering them.\nThe timing couldn’t have been more insidiously planned as police released the affidavit on the day of Jean’s funeral—despite having allegedly found the marijuana last week.\nAccording to the affidavit, when they searched his home, police claimed to have found 10.4 grams of pot—less than half an ounce.\nPolice also said they found two fired cartridge casings, a police backpack and vest, and a metal marijuana grinder—the horror.\nEven if police did find marijuana, why on earth would they execute a search warrant on an innocent dead man’s home and then release that information to the public?\ntake our poll - story continues below\nWho should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?\nWho should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?\nWho should replace

[police] immediately began looking to smear him,” attorney Lee Merritt said.\n“I think it’s unfortunate that law enforcement begin to immediately criminalize the victim—in this case, someone who was clearly was the victim that has absolutely no bearing on the fact that he was shot in his home,” Merritt added to Fox 4.\nPointing out the glaring nature of the smear campaign was the fact that there has been absolutely zero information released about the warrants conducted on officer Amber Guyger, the killer cop who lived just below Jean.\n“I would love to see more information coming out about the warrants executed on the home of the shooter who lived just below him.\nI haven’t seen any of those,” said Merritt.\nMerritt accused the department of conducting a “common assassination attempt on the victim that we often see in law enforcement involved shootings.” Sadly, he appears to be correct in his accusations.\nIt is standard procedure for police to dig up dirt on their victims in attempts to smear and assassinate their character to make the killer cops look good in the public eye.\nEven sadder, however, is the fact that these smear campaigns work most of the time.\nAs the Free Thought Project reported on Wednesday, according to police — who continue to attempt to spin this story into some tragic mistake — Guyger accidentally went into the wrong apartment, mistook Jean for an intruder and killed him.\n“Guyger entered the building and walked down the fourth-floor hallway to what she thought was her apartment,” according to the arrest warrant made public Monday afternoon.\n“She inserted a unique door key, with an electronic chip, into the door keyhole.\nThe door, which was slightly ajar prior to Guyger’s arrival, fully opened under the force of the key insertion.”\n“Guyger drew her firearm, gave verbal commands that were ignored by … Jean,” according to the warrant.\n“Guyger fired her handgun two times striking [Jean] in the torso.\nGuyger entered the apartment, immediately called 911, requesting police and EMS, and provided first aid to … Jean.\n“Due to the interior darkness of the apartment, Guyger turned on the interior lights while on the phone with 911.\nUpon being asked where she was located by emergency dispatchers, Guyger returned to the front door to observe the address and discovered she was at the wrong apartment,” according to the arrest warrant.\nAt no time, according to the warrant, does Guyger say what “verbal commands” she gave.\nWhat’s more, any verbal commands she did give were entirely irrelevant as she was the intruder—not Jean.\nAttempting to imply that Jean was somehow at fault for his own death for disobeying the commands of a homicidal cop who’d just illegally broken into his home is as irresponsible as it is reprehensible.\nWhat’s more, according to the attorneys for Jean, when Guyger was on the phone with police, she had to go outside to verify the address of the apartment—implying that she knew she was in the wrong apartment from the start.\n“From the fact that when you look at an affidavit and I’m thinking that I’m at my house and I call 911 because someone was just shot,” Attorney Daryl Washington said.\n“Well, the very first thing that I’m going to do is I’m not going to go outside and look at my address?\nI’m going to give them my address right there on the phone.\nI’m going to say I’m on the phone.\nMy address is this.\nWhy did she have to go outside to verify the address?\nIt makes no sense whatsoever.”\nEven more ominous than having to verify the address is the fact that according to witnesses, Guyger’s story of inserting the key into Jean’s door and it opening up was simply not true.\nAccording to witnesses, Guyger was banging on Jean’s door, demanding he let her in.\n“Independent witnesses have already come forward to say that they heard this officer pounding on the door and demanding to be let in,” Lee Merritt, one of the attorneys representing the Jean family, told ABC News.\n“The contradictions begin to build from there.”\nThe doors in the complex are also equipped with an automatic closing mechanism.\nThis was demonstrated by the attorneys who opened the door and released it several times—showing that it closed every single time—blowing the claim that the door was somehow ajar completely out of the water.\nJean’s family also pointed out that it would have been incredibly unlikely for Guyger to mistake Jean’s apartment for her own as he had a distinct red door mat which would have been enough for the cop to know she was at the wrong place.\nThe hallway outside the apartment where Botham Jean was shot and killed by a Dallas Police officer.\npic.twitter.com/2xN9xqppRC — Allison Harris (@AllisonFox4News) September 8, 2018\nEven as cops come to Guyger’s defense and attempt to shame, smear, and discredit her victim—who was an upstanding member of society regardless of the plant they claim to have found—they are failing miserably.\nDespite cops rallying behind the blue line to defend this killer cop, the rest of the country is not buying it.\nIn a damning tweet, writer Kashana Cauley summed up the nature of the smear campaign quite succinctly.\nIn response to cops claiming to find a tiny bit of weed, she pointed out that there was also a homicidal cop inside too.\nHis apartment also contained an off duty homicidal cop.\nhttps://t.co/Nq5wDpmukq — Kashana (@kashanacauley) September 13, 2018\nArticle posted with permission from The Free Thought Project\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":

Kelly of Washington, D.C., who was appointed by Trump, ruled against the administration and ordered Acosta’s hard pass restored for 14 days, pending further hearings in the lawsuit.\nBut it was not a vindication of Acosta’s free speech rights under the First Amendment.\nThe judge specifically said that the First Amendment claim made by Acosta and CNN had not yet been adjudicated and added that the president was free not to call on Acosta at future press conferences.\nThe temporary restraining order was nowhere to be found online at press time, but according to media reports, Kelly found that the administration violated Acosta’s due process rights under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.\nThe White House vowed to remedy the situation by drawing up rules governing press conferences.\nThe U.S. Department of Justice said the court ruling was disappointing.\n“The President has broad authority to regulate access to the White House, including to ensure fair and orderly White House events and press conferences.\nWe look forward to continuing to defend the White House's lawful actions.\"\nAcosta ignorantly blathered on to reporters when he returned to the White House Friday after the court ruling, incorrectly claiming he won a great First Amendment victory.\n\"I'm very grateful for what happened today,\" Acosta said.\n\"I'm grateful for my colleagues in the press who stood by us through all of this.\"\n\"This was a test and I think we passed the test,\" he said.\n\"Journalists need to know that in this country their First Amendment rights of freedom of the press are sacred, they're protected in our Constitution,\" Acosta said.\n\"Throughout all of this I was confident and I thought that this would be the result at the end of the day that our rights would be protected as we continue to cover our government and hold our leaders accountable.\"\nThe court case isn’t over yet.\nThe legal antagonists have to report to the court Monday afternoon.\nThe court ordered the parties to “file a joint status report proposing how they would like to proceed in this case by 3:00 p.m. on November 19, 2018[,]” according to its online docket.\nAccording to CNN, “White House officials sent Acosta a letter stating that his pass is set to be suspended again once the restraining order expires.”\nFrom the looks of the letter, the W.H.\nis trying to establish a paper trail that will empower the administration to boot Acosta again at the end of the month.\nCNN responded with this statement on Sunday: \"The White House is continuing to violate the First and 5th Amendments of the Constitution.\nThese actions threaten all journalists and news organizations.\nJim Acosta and CNN will continue to report the news about the White House and the President.\"\nThe Acosta-CNN lawsuit was filed by Ted Boutrous and Trump-hating Republican lawyer Ted Olson, of the law firm Gibson, Dunn, and Crutcher.\nOlson was solicitor general in President George W. Bush’s administration.\n(The legal complaint may be viewed here.)\nBoutrous said CNN is prepared to dig in for a protracted legal fight if it needs to.\n\"We're ready to litigate as long as we have to, to protect these First Amendment rights, to ask the court to declare rules of the road going forward,\" he said.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Loaded_Language\t383\t397\nLoaded_Language\t3154\t3163\nFlag-Waving\t3641\t3657\nBlack-and-White_Fallacy\t1435\t1506\nName_Calling,Labeling\t3119\t3125\nLoaded_Language\t2893\t2906\nExaggeration,Minimisation\t3275\t3306\nName_Calling,Labeling\t1244\t1261\nName_Calling,Labeling\t4828\t4851\nName_Calling,Labeling\t1741\t1751\nLoaded_Language\t3143\t3153\nName_Calling,Labeling\t1319\t1334\nLoaded_Language\t1837\t1850\n"}]}

Lasnik in Seattle.\nThe injunction extends a ruling last month that barred the Trump administration from taking steps that would allow the firm Defense Distributed to disseminate 3D gun blueprints.\n“When the Trump Administration inexplicably gave the green light to distribute on the internet blueprints of 3D-printed, untraceable ghost guns, it needlessly endangered our children, our loved ones and our men and women in law enforcement,” Becerra said in a statement.\n“The Trump Administration’s actions were dangerous and incompetent.”\nThe action Monday keeps in place a July 31 court decision blocking the Trump administration pending a decision on the merits of a lawsuit by states opposed to the blueprints being published.\n“The Court finds that the irreparable burdens on the private defendants’ First Amendment rights are dwarfed by the irreparable harms the States are likely to suffer if the existing restrictions are withdrawn and that, overall, the public interest strongly supports maintaining the status quo through the pendency of this litigation,” Lasnik wrote in his decision.\n— Patrick McGreevy\nLos Angeles Times\n———\n©2018 Los Angeles Times, Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nThe radical leftist gun grabbing anti-liberty California General Xavier Becerra is lying when he says the “Trump Administration inexplicably gave the green light to distribute on the internet blueprints of 3D-printed, untraceable ghost guns.” The Department of Just(Us) settled a 1st Amendment claim filed by Cody Wilson, who created the code for 3-D guns.\nIt was a case the government was about to lose.\nThe settlement was approved by a federal judge.\nBecerra’s statement, “it needlessly endangered our children, our loved ones and our men and women in law enforcement,” is preposterous left-wing political argle-bargle.\nI suspect the Washington judge’s stay will be overturned on appeal, but certainly will if it makes it to the Supreme Court.\nThe federal government has no standing to restrict speech in this manner.\n–BL\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Loaded_Language\t902\t923\nRepetition\t887\t897\nRepetition\t957\t960\nDoubt\t1842\t1847\nFlag-Waving\t924\t993\nLoaded_Language\t2367\t2379\nLoaded_Language\t2334\t2346\nLoaded_Language\t1066\t1091\nRepetition\t875\t886\nRepetition\t938\t941\nName_Calling,Labeling\t2347\t2379\nLoaded_Language\t1311\t1322\nName_Calling,Labeling\t1763\t1823\nRepetition\t1400\t1411\n"}]}

Bush, and Obama regimes created between the two superpowers.\nYes, Russia is a superpower.\nRussian weapons are so superior to the junk produced by the waste-filled US military/security complex that lives high off the hog on the insouciant American taxpayer that it is questionable if the US is even a second class military power.\nIf the insane neoconservatives, such as Max Boot, William Kristol, and the rest of the neocon scum get their way, the US, the UK, and Europe will be a radioactive ruin for thousands of years.\nHouse Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi (CA), Minority Leader of the US House of Representatives, declared that out of fear of some undefined retribution from Putin, a dossier on Trump perhaps, the President of the United States sold out the American people to Russia because he wants to make peace: “It begs the question, what does Vladimir Putin, what do the Russians have on Donald Trump—personally, politically and financially that he should behave in such a manner?” The “such a manner” Pelosi is speaking about is making peace instead of war.\nThe Tyranny of Good In... Paul Craig Roberts, La... Best Price: $5.64 Buy New $5.00 (as of 10:35 EDT - Details)\nTo be clear, the Democratic Minority Leader of the US House of Representatives has accused Donald Trump of high treason against the United States.\nThere is no outcry against this blatantly false accusation, totally devoid of evidence.\nThe presstitute media instead of protesting this attempt at a coup against the President of the United States, trumpet the accusation as self-evident truth.\nTrump is a traitor because he wants peace with Russia.\nHere is Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer (NY) repeating Pelosi’s false accusation: “Millions of Americans will continue to wonder if the only possible explanation for this dangerous behavior is the possibility that President Putin holds damaging information over President Trump.” If you don’t believe that this is orchestrated between Pelosi and Schumer, you are stupid beyond belief.\nHere is disgraced Obama CIA director John Brennan, a leader of the fake Russiagate campaign against President Trump in order to prevent Trump from making peace with Russia and, thus, by making the world safer, threatening the massive, unjustified budget of the military/security complex: “Donald Trump’s press conference performance in Helsinki rises to and exceeds the threshold of high crimes and misdemeanors.\nIt was nothing short of treasonous.\nNot only were Trump’s comments imbecilic, he is wholly in the pocket of Putin.\nRepublican Patriots: Where are you??\n?”\nHere are many more.\nAnd here is more from the CIA bought-and-paid-for BBC.\nNOTICE THAT NOT ONE WESTERN MEDIA SOURCE IS CELEBRATING AND THANKING TRUMP AND PUTIN FOR EASING THE ARTIFICAILLY CREATED TENSIONS THAT WERE LEADING TO NUCLEAR WAR.\nHOW CAN THIS BE?\nHOW CAN IT BE THAT THE WESTERN MEDIA IS SO OPPOSED TO PEACE?\nWHAT IS THE EXPLANATION?\nThe Russians, the Chinese, the Iranians, and the North Koreans, as well as the rest of the world, desperately need to notice the extremely hostile reaction to peace on the part of the US Democratic Party, many members of the Republican Party, including the despicable US Republican Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, and the Western Presstitute Media, a collection of people on the CIA payroll according to the German newspaper editor, Udo Ulfkotte, and the CIA itself.\nNancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, John McCain, Lindsey Graham, and the rest of the corrupt filth that rules over us are all in the pay of the military/security complex.\nJust go and investigate the donations to their re-election campaigns.\nThe 1,000 billion dollar budget of the military/security complex, amplified by the CIA’s front corporations and narcotics business, provides enormous sums with which to purchase the senators and representatives that the insouciant American voters think that they elect.\nDo you know how large 1,000 billion is?\nYou would have to live for thousands of years and do nothing for 24/7 except count to reach that figure.\nIt is a sum that nurtures the recipients, and the recipients regard it as worth protecting.\nTherefore, the American public gets not representation, but lies that justify war and conflict.\nThe military/security complex, about which President Eisenhower warned the American people to no effect, is in desperate need of an enemy.\nIn obedience to the military/security complex, the Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama regimes have made Russia that enemy.\nIf Trump and Putin do not understand this, they will easily be made irrelevant.\nThey both can be assassinated, and that is what the statements from Pelosi, Schumer, McCain, Lindsey Graham, et.\nal., repeated endlessly in the propaganda ministry that is the Western press, encourages.\nTrump can be assassinated or overthrown in a political coup for selling out America to Russia, as members of both political parties claim and as the media trumpets endlessly.\nPutin can be easily assassinated by the CIA operatives that the Russian government stupidly permits to operate throughout Russia in NGOs and Western/US owned media and among the Atlanticist Integrationists, Washington’s Firth Column inside Russia serving Washington’s purposes.\nThese Russian traitors serve in Putin’s own government!\nThe Neoconservative Th... Dr. Paul Craig Roberts Best Price: $11.96 Buy New $19.34 (as of 02:05 EDT - Details)\nAmericans are so unaware that they have no idea of the risk that President Trump is taking by challenging the US military security complex.\nFor example, during the last half of the 1970s I was a member of the US Senate staff.\nI was working together with a staffer of the US Republican Senator from California, S. I. Hayakawa, to advance understanding of a supply-side economic policy cure to the stagflation that threatened the US budget’s ability to meet its obligations.\nRepublican Senators Hatch, Roth, and Hayakawa were trying to introduce a supply-side economic policy as a cure for the stagflation that was threatening the US economy with failure.\nThe Democrats, who later in the Senate led the way to a supply-side policy, were, at this time, opposed (see Paul Craig Roberts, The Supply-Side Revolution, Harvard University Press, 1984).\nThe Democrats claimed that the policy would worsen the budget deficit, the only time in those days Democrats cared about the budget deficit.\nThe Democrats said that they would support the tax rate reductions if the Republicans would support offsetting cuts in the budget to support a balanced budget.\nThis was a ploy to put Republicans on the spot for taking away some groups’ handouts in order “to cut tax rates for the rich.”\nThe supply-side policy did not require budget cuts, but in order to demonstrate the Democrats lack of sincerety, Hayakawa’s aid and I had our senators introduce a series of budget cuts together with tax cuts that, on a static revenue basis (not counting tax revenue feedbacks from the incentives of the lower tax rates) kept the budget even, and the Democrats voted against them every time.\nWhen the combination of tax cuts with defense budget cuts came up for a vote, the legendary senator Strom Thurmond, a 48-year member of the US Senate from South Carolina, tapped me on the shoulder.\nHe said: “son, never set your senator up against the military/security complex.\nHe will not be re-elected, and you will be out of a job.” I replied that we were just establishing for the record that under no conditions would the Democrats, who wanted more government, vote for a tax rate reduction even if there was a case that it would cure stagflation.\nHe replied: “son, the military/security complex doesn’t care.”\nMy emergence from The Matrix began with Thurmond’s pat on my shoulder.\nIt grew with my time at the Wall Street Journal when I learned that some truthful things simply could not be said.\nIn the Treasury I experienced how those outside interests opposed to a president’s policy marshall their forces and the media that they own to block it.\nLater as a member of a secret presidential committee, I saw how the CIA attempted to prevent President Reagan from ending the Cold War.\nToday, right now, at this moment, we are faced with a massive effort of the military/security complex, the neoconservatives, the Democratic Party, and the presstitute media to discredit the elected President of the United States and to overthrow him in order that the utterly corrupt elite that rule American can continue to hold on to power and to protect the massive budget of the military/security complex that, along with the Israel Lobby, funds the elections of those who rule us.\nTrump, like Reagan, was an exception, and it is the exceptions that accumulate the ire of the corrupt leftwing, bought off with money, and the ire of the media, concentrated into small tight ownership groups indebted to those who permitted the illegal concentration of a once independent and diverse American media that once served, on occasion, as a watchdog over government.\nThe rightwing, wrapped in the flag, dismisses all truth as “anti-American.”\nIf Putin, Lavrov, the Russian government, the traitorous Russian Fifth Column—the Atlanticist Integrationists—the Chinese, the Iranians, the North Koreans think that any peace or consideration can come out of America, they are insane.\nTheir delusions are setting themselves up for destruction.\nThere is no institution in America, government or private, that can be trusted.\nAny government or person who trusts America or any Western country is stupid beyond belief.\nThe entire Russiagate hoax is an orchestration by the military/security complex, led by John Brennen, Comey, and Rosenstein.\nThe purpose is to discredit President trump for two reasons.\nOne is to prevent any normalization of relations with Russia.\nThe other is to remove Trump’s agenda as an alternative to the agenda of the Democratic Party.\nHow America Was Lost: ... Dr. Paul Craig Roberts Best Price: $8.00 Buy New $8.51 (as of 02:00 EDT - Details)\nPresident Trump is almost powerless.\nPutin, the Chinese, the Iranians, and the North Koreans should recognize this before it is too late for them.\nPresident Trump cannot fire and arrest for high treason Mueller and Rosenstein.\nAnd Trump cannot indict Hillary for her numerous unquestionable crimes in plain view of everyone, or Comey or Brennan, who declares Trump “to be wholly in the pocket of Putin,” for trying to overthrow the elected president of the United States.\nTrump cannot have the Secret Service question the likes of Pelosi and Schumer and McCain and Lindsey Graham for false accusations that encourage assassination of the President of the United States.\nTrump cannot even trust the Secret Service, which accumulated evidence suggests was complicit in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and Robert Kennedy.\nIf Putin and Lavrov, so anxious to be friends of Washington, let their guards down, they are history.\nAs I said above, Russiagate is an orchestratration to prevent peace between the US and Russia.\nLeading military/security complex experts, including the person who provided the CIA’s daily briefing of the President of the United States for many years, and the person who devised the spy program for the National Security Agency, have proven conclusively that Russiagate is a hoax designed for the purpose of preventing President Trump from normalizing relations between the US and Russia, which has the power to destroy the entirety of the Western World at will.\nHere is the report from the retired security professionals who, unlike those still in office, cannot be fired and deprived of a careet for telling the truth.\nHere is what the clued-in Russian Defense Minister Shoigu has to say about the aggressive actions of the West against the Russian homeland.\nIf Putin doesn’t listen to him, Russia is in the trash can of history.\nKeep in mind that no media informs you better than my website.\nIf my website goes down, you will be left in darkness.\nNo valid information comes from the US government or the Western presstitutes.\nIf you sit in front of the TV screen watching the Western media, you are brainwashed beyond all hope.\nNot even I can rescue you.\nNor God himself.\nAmericans, and indeed the Russians themselves, are incapable of realizing it, but there is a chance that Trump will be overthrown and a Western assault will be launched against the handful of countries that insist on sovereignty.\nI doubt that few of the Americans who elected Trump will be taken in by the anti-Trump propagana, but they are not organized and have no armed power.\nThe police, militarized by George W. Bush and Obama, will be set against them.\nThe rebellions will be local and suppressed by every violation of the US Constitution by the private powers that rule Washington, as always has been the case with rebellions in America.\nIn the West, which the Russians are so anxious to join, all freedoms are dead—freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of inquiry, freedom of privacy, freedom from arbitrary search, freedom from arbitrary arrest, along with the Constitutional protections of due process and habeas corpus.\nToday there are no countries less free than the United States of America.\nWhy do the Russian Atlanticist Integrationists want to join an unfree Western world?\nAre they that brainwashed by Western Propaganda?\nIf Putin listens to these deluded fools, Putin will destroy Russia.\nThere is something wrong with Russian perception of Washington.\nApparently the Russian elite, with the exception of Shoigu and a few others are incapable of comprehending the neoconservative drive for US world hegemony and the neoconservative determination to destroy Russia as a constraint on US unilateralism.\nThe Russian government somehow, despite all evidence to the contrary, believes that Washington’s hegemony is negotiable.\nThe Best of Paul Craig Roberts\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thought-terminating_Cliches\t182\t198\nCausal_Oversimplification\t2148\t2201\nExaggeration,Minimisation\t12573\t12796\nFlag-Waving\t5357\t5450\nRepetition\t13936\t13948\nLoaded_Language\t3628\t3655\nFlag-Waving\t5977\t6115\nName_Calling,Labeling\t5294\t5343\nExaggeration,Minimisation\t667\t904\nName_Calling,Labeling\t7718\t7740\nName_Calling,Labeling\t9712\t9747\nName_Calling,Labeling\t4425\t4456\nExaggeration,Minimisation\t13763\t13835\nLoaded_Language\t10114\t10134\nName_Calling,Labeling\t13997\t14010\nRepetition\t279\t286\nFlag-Waving\t2287\t2481\nDoubt\t667\t904\nName_Calling,Labeling\t11541\t11617\nLoaded_Language\t3069\t3115\nBlack-and-White_Fallacy\t2484\t2587\nName_Calling,Labeling\t19\t28\nLoaded_Language\t8532\t8554\nRepetition\t13656\t13664\nName_Calling,Labeling\t2597\t2638\nLoaded_Language\t12426\t12453\nName_Calling,Labeling\t3752\t3820\nRepetition\t655\t665\nExaggeration,Minimisation\t13443\t13520\nBlack-and-White_Fallacy\t7848\t7973\nExaggeration,Minimisation\t12012\t12084\nFlag-Waving\t12319\t12382\nFlag-Waving\t1289\t1363\nFlag-Waving\t4429\t4455\nExaggeration,Minimisation\t1024\t1096\nThought-terminating_Cliches\t8211\t8253\nName_Calling,Labeling\t2567\t2587\nFlag-Waving\t9594\t9667\nName_Calling,Labeling\t5816\t5833\nLoaded_Language\t9888\t9903\nFlag-Waving\t769\t904\nLoaded_Language\t224\t242\nName_Calling,Labeling\t11896\t12010\nFlag-Waving\t8731\t9215\nName_Calling,Labeling\t977\t1005\nName_Calling,Labeling\t8995\t9040\nName_Calling,Labeling\t3117\t3137\nName_Calling,Labeling\t9566\t9592\nLoaded_Language\t4053\t4067\nLoaded_Language\t1935\t1961\nName_Calling,Labeling\t10147\t10163\nFlag-Waving\t13028\t13124\nExaggeration,Minimisation\t10855\t10911\nExaggeration,Minimisation\t12455\t12516\nLoaded_Language\t8259\t8285\nFlag-Waving\t3117\t3151\nLoaded_Language\t2567\t2587\nWhataboutism\t1981\t2147\nLoaded_Language\t9356\t9376\nLoaded_Language\t993\t1005\n"}]}

KEITH ELLISON’S DIVORCE RECORDS\nBy Jesse Van Berkel, Star Tribune, September 26, 2018:\ntake our poll - story continues below\nWho should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?\nWho should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?\nWho should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?\n* John Bolton Richard Grenell Dina Powell Heather Nauert Ivanka Trump\nEmail *\nEmail This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\nCompleting this poll grants you access to Freedom Outpost updates free of charge.\nYou may opt out at anytime.\nYou also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\nThe Star Tribune has joined a legal effort to unseal the divorce records of U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison, the Democratic candidate for attorney general.\nEllison and his ex-wife, Kim Ellison, divorced in 2012.\nThe related records have been sealed, so the public cannot access the information.\nThe Star Tribune’s motion to intervene and unseal the records follows a similar action by Alpha News, a right-leaning online news and opinion site.\nThe efforts follow allegations by Ellison’s ex-girlfriend, Karen Monahan, that Ellison domestically abused her in 2016.\nHe has denied the allegation repeatedly, and Monahan has continued to press her case in frequent tweets about Ellison.\nOn Sunday, Monahan tweeted to Ellison: “This is not going away and you are making it worse for you, your family and district by lying, smearing, getting others to do your dirty work, victim shaming, etc.” She referred again to a video she says she has of Ellison dragging her off a bed, which he has said did not happen.\nShe has declined to show the video, saying it is traumatizing.\nShe also told CNN she misplaced it.\nMonahan also recently released a medical record that shows she told a doctor in 2017 that she had been in an abusive relationship with Ellison.\nKen Martin, the chairman of the Minnesota DFL, said Tuesday that the party’s investigation of the allegations against Ellison will be finished soon, then released to the public.\nAn external investigator was hired to conduct the inquiry.\nThe Star Tribune argued that, given the public interest around that situation and Kim Ellison’s public support of her ex-husband, the divorce records are a matter of concern to voters.\nDivorce records are typically public, but judges will often agree to seal them if both parties to the case agree and no one else objects.\nThe Ellison campaign released a statement from Kim Ellison on behalf of both her and Keith Ellison.\n“Our divorce simply isn’t the public’s business, and therefore, when we separated, we jointly asked the court to seal the file.\nNow, one month before a closely contested election for Minnesota Attorney General, a conservative group wants to probe our divorce file in search of something to use against Keith in this race.\nI am disappointed that the Star Tribune would choose to file this motion.”\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Loaded_Language\t2221\t2228\nLoaded_Language\t2166\t2174\nName_Calling,Labeling\t455\t471\nLoaded_Language\t2401\t2413\nLoaded_Language\t668\t681\nName_Calling,Labeling\t226\t239\nLoaded_Language\t226\t233\nLoaded_Language\t2202\t2212\n"}]}

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 13, 2018\nWe'll see how things turn out and I'm sure Senator Paul is not issuing an empty threat in the matter.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Exaggeration,Minimisation\t1859\t1947\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice\t1722\t1786\nThought-terminating_Cliches\t1476\t1525\nDoubt\t795\t842\nAppeal_to_Authority\t1722\t1752\nWhataboutism\t2733\t2860\nAppeal_to_Authority\t2935\t2961\nRed_Herring\t2580\t2596\nFlag-Waving\t2010\t2121\nFlag-Waving\t1190\t1239\nSlogans\t1533\t1552\nAppeal_to_Authority\t474\t579\nExaggeration,Minimisation\t2935\t2962\nCausal_Oversimplification\t2559\t2732\nFlag-Waving\t1554\t1662\n"}]}

Mohammad Bagheri, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) military commander and chief of staff of Iran’s armed forces, warned that “putting the Revolutionary Guard in the terrorist lists with terrorist groups can be very costly to the United States and its military bases and forces in the region.” IRGC commander Mohammad Ali Jafari said on October 8th that \"if the news is correct about the stupidity of the American government in considering the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist group, then the Revolutionary Guards will consider the American army to be like Islamic State all around the world.\"\nThe next day the Iranian regime warned of a \"crushing\" response if the United States were to designate the IRGC as a terrorist organization.\nPresident Trump has called the Iranian regime’s bluff with his announcement last week that he would do just that.\nDesignating the IRGC as a terrorist organization and imposing new sanctions for its aggressive actions in the region is not a restoration of the sanctions lifted by the Obama administration as part of its disastrous nuclear deal with Iran.\nIf Iran insists it can do what it wants militarily in terms of missile launches, support of terrorist groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas, and arms transfers without violating the nuclear deal, then the United States can certainly act to curb such activities through financial pressure.\nThe U.S. can impose sanctions against the Iranian regime’s principal instrument for projecting aggressive, destabilizing force outside of its borders without violating the nuclear deal.\nThe Iranian regime does not see it that way, however.\nWith the lifting of the nuclear-related sanctions making available billions of dollars to Iran’s leaders to further finance the IRGC’s exploits in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and elsewhere, the regime is furious that the Trump administration is tightening the financial screws again, even if for reasons not directly related to Iran’s compliance with the terms of the nuclear deal.\nThus, it is threatening U.S. forces and bases in the region.\nA couple of seemingly unrelated events this past week point to Iran’s positioning itself for more aggressive military actions that could place U.S. forces in harm’s way.\nOn Tuesday, Major General Bagheri landed in Damascus for talks with Syrian President Bashar Assad and senior Syrian officials, including the defense minister and the chief of staff of the Syrian armed forces.\nBagheri is quoted as saying that his visit’s purpose was to “put a joint strategy on continuing co-ordination and co-operation at the military level.” Some experts on Iran believe that Bagheri’s visit to Damascus at this time is intended to reinforce a message that Iran will continue to supply weaponry to Syria and to reinforce the presence of its terrorist proxy Hezbollah in Syria.\nThis will not only serve to bolster the Assad regime, but it also will strengthen Iran's ability to follow through on its threats to the U.S. and its allies, principally Israel.\nMeanwhile, following the departure of the Kurds from Kirkuk, Iraq earlier this week, the IRGC’s operational Al Qods arm reportedly established a command center and five bases there.\nAccording to Debkafile, this constitutes “the first military facility Iran has ever established openly in Iraq.” The Kirkuk region holds 45 percent of Iraqi’s oil.\nThe Iraqi branch of Iran’s terrorist proxy Hezbollah has vowed that once ISIS is defeated it will start killing Americans, as it has done before.\nIt is against this backdrop that U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley used her entire speech to the UN Security Council on Wednesday to denounce the Iranian regime on multiple grounds.\nThe session was supposed to be devoted to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but Ambassador Haley departed from the monthly ritual during which Israel is normally singled out for criticism by other Council members.\nShe went after Iran instead.\nShe explained why the Trump administration decided to take “a comprehensive approach to confronting the Iranian regime,” which does not give the regime a get out of jail free card even if it is in technical compliance with the loophole-ridden nuclear deal agreed to by the Obama administration.\n“We can’t talk about stability in the Middle East without talking about Iran,” Ambassador Haley said.\n“That’s because nearly every threat to peace and security in the Middle East is connected to Iran’s outlaw behavior.\nThe United States has now embarked on a course that attempts to address all aspects of Iran’s destructive conduct, not just one aspect.\nIt’s critical that the international community do the same.\nJudging Iran by the narrow confines of the nuclear deal misses the true nature of the threat.\nIran must be judged in totality of its aggressive, destabilizing, and unlawful behavior.\nTo do otherwise would be foolish.”\nAmbassador Haley accused the Iranian regime of continuing to “play” the Security Council.\n“Iran hides behind its assertion of technical compliance with the nuclear deal while it brazenly violates the other limits on its behavior.\nAnd we have allowed them to get away with it.\nThis must stop.”\nAmbassador Haley proceeded to list various violations by the Iranian regime of Security Council resolutions pertaining to the transfer of conventional weapons from Iran and the arming of terrorist groups, including the Houthi rebels in Yemen and Hezbollah.\nShe also pointed to what she called the Iranian regime’s “most threatening act” – its launch of ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons.\n“When a rogue regime starts down the path of ballistic missiles, it tells us that we will soon have another North Korea on our hands,” Ambassador Haley said.\n“If it is wrong for North Korea to do this, why doesn’t that same mentality apply to Iran?\n“\nAs for the Iran’s supposed technical compliance with its commitments under the nuclear deal itself, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the UN’s international inspectors are not able to visit Iran’s military sites.\nPast work on nuclear explosive trigger devices appears to have taken place at one or more such sites in the past.\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Yukiya Amano admitted last month that when it comes to the IAEA’s capacity to check whether Iran was conducting work on a nuclear explosive device, his agency’s “tools are limited.” The Iranian regime has also attempted to skirt the restrictions in the JCPOA on its procurement of materials, equipment, goods and technology related to Iran’s nuclear activities.\nThe Heritage Foundation noted in its recent report on the JCPOA, for example, that Iran was “caught red-handed trying to purchase nuclear technology and restricted ballistic missile technology from German companies.”\nU.S. intelligence had discovered North Korea’s transfer of missile parts to Iran at the very same time that Iran was negotiating the nuclear deal, in clear violation of UN Security Council resolutions then in effect.\nThe Obama administration chose to look the other way.\nDoes anybody with a modicum of sense really believe that such collaboration between the two rogue nations is not going on today?\nIran is flush with cash, thanks to the JCPOA.\nIt wants to build out its missile and nuclear enrichment capabilities.\nIn addition to covert transfers of materials and technology to Iran in violation of the nuclear deal, the JCPOA may provide a loophole for Iran to exploit in outsourcing some of the development work to North Korea for hard currency, which North Korea desperately needs.\nThey are a perfect match for each other.\nProponents of the JCPOA argue that exiting the nuclear deal unless it is changed to the Trump administration’s satisfaction would undermine U.S. credibility with North Korea and thereby kill any chance of negotiations to resolve the crisis caused by North Korea's continued testing of sophisticated nuclear arms and ballistic missiles.\n\"If we want to talk to North Korea now, the possible end for the nuclear deal with Iran would jeopardize the credibility of such treaties,\" Reuters quoted German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel as saying.\nGermany is one of the parties to the JCPOA.\nOther European allies have voiced similar concerns.\nSo have Obama’s former Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry.\nThis argument is absurd on its face.\nThe whole point is to prevent Iran from becoming the next North Korea, not to kick the can down the road as usual.\nNorth Korea’s aggressive pursuit of nuclear weapons and of intercontinental ballistic missiles equipped with nuclear warheads proves that weak agreements full of front-loaded goodies rewarding rogue regimes for elusive promises are worthless.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":

Keith Ellison (D-MN) is the epitome of an effeminate man today in America.\nHe stands accused by two women who claim that he not only verbally abused them, but physically assaulted them as well, and no, these women didn't wait decades or even till there was a politically opportune time to voice their accusations.\nOne even had reported him to the police.\nInvestigative journalist Laura Loomer was informed by police in Minnesota that he wanted police protection from her when he found out she was attending the education forum that was held Saturday.\nThis is a man who follows a demonic religion, Islam, and supports cop killers.\nHe does all of this while he stands accused of abusing women and running to be attorney general in Minnesota, even though he possesses no attorney's license that is valid.\nHere's Loomer's tweet from Sunday with video of her speaking to a policeman about it.\ntake our poll - story continues below\nWho should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?\nWho

Police in MN & told them he wanted police protection from me when he found out I was attending the education forum that was held yesterday.\nTHAT IS WHY the police were there.\n👇🏻 pic.twitter.com/ABIvsJNW4d — Laura Loomer (@LauraLoomer) September 23, 2018\nOn Saturday, there was an education panel at the Education Minnesota Apple Valley open to union members and guests.\nPrior to the event, Ellison's campaign called police to ensure that he was \"protected\" from a woman armed with a mic and camera phone .\nLoomer peppered him with questions about the alleged abuse at a State Attorney General debate Friday night.\nShe stood alongside other female survivors of abuse.\nEllison not only claimed the women were lying but then fled the scene.\nAt least he said something there, which is more than I can say for his response earlier in September when Loomer confronted him at another event with questions.\nFailing to answer, Ellison tried to move from person to person, allowing his minions to try and provide cover for him, similar to that of Maxine Waters, but there was no \"member's only\" elevator to flee into.\nFinally, Ellison fled the scene, hounding by Loomer and others questioning him about the abuse.\nThe irony is of Ellison's campaign calling on the police to protect him from a woman, armed with a mic and camera phone, who is simply asking him to respond to the accusations and police report, as well as how he plans on being attorney general without a license, when he has shown his support for those that murder police officers in cold blood.\nScott Johnson reports on Ellison's sordid history supporting such criminals.\nEllison was an active supporter and local leader of the Nation of Islam in Minneapolis before his election to Congress.\n(I set forth this history in some detail in the October 9, 2006 issue of The Weekly Standard.)\nEllison has baldly dissembled about this history since 2006.\nIn his 2014 memoir My Country, ’Tis of Thee ,for example, Ellison simply omitted it and presented himself as a critic of Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam.\nThis past June, Ellison told Jake Tapper on CNN, “I worked on the Million Man March and I was proud to do so.\nThat’s it.” But that wasn’t it.\nEllison first sought office as a Democrat in 1998 as Keith Ellison-Muhammad, a self-avowed member of the Nation of Islam.\n(Ellison-Muhammad is just one of three Nation of Islam names Ellison has used over the years.)\nFortunately for him, Ellison’s 5th District constituents haven’t much cared about his history and the Minneapolis Star Tribune has almost entirely let it rest exactly where Ellison wants it.\nBut seeking the top law enforcement job in Minnesota and running for statewide office should be a more daunting challenge because Ellison is an extraordinarily poor fit for the job.\nAmong the troubling threads that run through Ellison’s career: support for cop killers.\nIn September 1992 Minneapolis police officer Jerry Haaf was murdered execution-style, shot in the back as he took a coffee break at a restaurant in south Minneapolis.\nPolice later determined that Haaf’s murder was a gang hit performed by four members of the city’s Vice Lords gang.The leader of the Vice Lords was Sharif Willis, a convicted murderer who had been released from prison and who sought respectability as a responsible gang leader from gullible municipal authorities while operating a gang front called United for Peace.\nThe four Vice Lords members who murdered Haaf met and planned the murder at Willis’s house.\nDespite the fact that two witnesses implicated Willis in the planning he was never charged because law enforcement authorities said they lacked sufficient evidence to convict him.\nAt the time, Ellison was a Minneapolis attorney in private practice.\nAnd within a month of Haaf’s murder, Ellison appeared with Willis supporting the United for Peace gang front.\nIn October 1992, Ellison helped organize a demonstration against Minneapolis police that included United for Peace.\n“The main point of our rally is to support United for Peace [in its fight against] the campaign of slander the police federation has been waging,” said Ellison.\nWillis was the last speaker at the demonstration.\nAccording to a contemporaneous report in the St. Paul Pioneer Press, Willis told the crowd that Minneapolis police were experiencing the same fear from young black men that blacks had felt from police for many years.\n“If the police have some fear, I understand that fear,” Willis said.\n“We seem to have an overabundance of bad police.\n.\n.\n.\n[W]e’re going to get rid of them,” Willis said.\n“They’ve got to go.” The Pioneer Press account concludes with Ellison’s contribution to the demonstration: “Ellison told the crowd that the police union is systematically frightening whites in order to get more police officers hired.\nThat way, Ellison said, the union can increase its power base.” Ellison publicly supported the Haaf murder defendants.\nIn February 1993, he spoke at a demonstration for one of them during his trial.\nEllison led the crowd assembled at the courthouse in a chant that was ominous in the context of Haaf’s cold-blooded murder: “We don’t get no justice, you don’t get no peace.” Ellison’s working relationship with Sharif Willis finally came to an end in February 1995, when Willis was convicted in federal court on several counts of drug and gun-related crimes and sent back to prison for 20 years.\nThe Haaf case wasn’t an aberration for Ellison.\nIn February 2000, he spoke at a fundraiser sponsored by the Minnesota chapter of the old National Lawyers Guild, on whose steering committee he had served—the chapter was raising funds for former Symbionese Liberation Army member Kathleen Soliah, who had been a fugitive from justice for 25 years, on charges related to the attempted pipe bombing of Los Angeles police officers in 1975.\n(The National Lawyers Guild is an old Communist front group that somehow survived the fall of the Soviet Union.\nRegimes come and go; dupes are forever.)\nIn his National Lawyers Guild speech Ellison spoke favorably of cop killers Mumia Abu-Jamal and “Assata Shakur” (Joanne Chesimard), who was wanted for the murder of New Jersey state trooper Werner Foerster in 1973.\nChesimard was convicted of that murder but escaped from prison in 1979 and has been on the lam in Cuba since 1984.\nBryan Burrough’s Days of Rage has a riveting account of Chesimard’s terrorist career.\nIn 2013, the FBI made Chesimard the first woman named to its Most Wanted Terrorists List.\nThe FBI has offered a reward of up to $1,000,000 for her capture.\nYet Ellison prayed for Chesimard in his National Lawyers Guild speech: “I am praying that Castro does not get to the point where he has to really barter with these guys over here because they’re going to get Assata Shakur, they’re going to get a whole lot of other people,” he told the crowd.\n“I hope the Cuba[n] people can stick to it, because the freedom of some good decent people depends on it.” Ellison’s support for Soliah/Olson in the speech is equally notable.\nHe denounced law enforcement authorities for prosecuting the attempted murder of police officers.\nReferring to the days Soliah/Olson had spent in the SLA under the leadership of Donald DeFreeze (“Field Marshal Cinque”), Ellison hailed Soliah/Olson as a “black gang member” and portrayed her as a victim of government persecution.\nHe described her as one of those who had been “fighting for freedom in the ‘60s and’70s” and called for her release.\nEllison to the contrary notwithstanding, Soliah/Olson pleaded guilty to the crimes charged in Los Angeles and to an additional murder charge in Sacramento.\nAccording to Ellison, Soliah/Olson was a social justice warrior fighting the good fight.\nThe case had nothing to do with the attempted murder of police officers; that was but a pretext.\nSeems he is more than willing to use the police to shield him from the press who will confront him publicly while taking the side of their murderers for political gain.\nShame on you, Hakim Muhammad!\nArticle posted with permission from Sons Of Liberty Media\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":

surrendered in the matter and accepted the fact that the plans are protected under the First Amendment.\nHowever, a federal judge, in a lawsuit brought by eight states and the District of Columbia, has blocked the plans from being released.\nThe judge should understand that these plans are protected under the First Amendment in the same way that any other printed material is, and that there is no crime that has been committed by making them available to people online.\nSecond, if that were not enough, we already know that the Second Amendment protects actual arms from restriction and the right to keep and bear them from infringement.\ntake our poll - story continues below\nWill Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?\nWill Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme

the story:\nU.S. District Judge Robert Lasnik issued the order a day after eight states sued the government to block a settlement reached by the Trump administration last month allowing a Texas-based company, Defense Distributed, to resume online-sharing of blueprints for the 3D firearms.\nThe company was set to allow downloads on Wednesday, although blueprints have been posted since Friday.\nThe temporary restraining order blocks the release until the next scheduled hearing on August 10.\nIn the meantime, Congressional Democrats have urged President Trump to reverse the decision letting Defense Distributed publish the plans.\nTrump said Tuesday that he's \"looking into\" the idea, saying making 3D plastic guns available to the public \"doesn't seem to make much sense!\"\nDoesn't make much sense?\nAre you people serious?\nWhy, yes, yes they are serious.\nDeadly serious.\nIt makes perfect sense when you have the same people who have absolutely no problem with mothers hiring hitmen to murder their babies in their wombs in the most brutal and barbaric fashion, and then sell off their body parts for profit, if they don't throw them in the trash or flush them down a toilet, calling for computer files to be kept by the government and not be allowed to be released to the public.\nThe eight states are the usual suspects, along with the District of Columbia, and we should note which ones they are.\nWashington\nConnecticut\nMaryland\nNew Jersey\nNew York\nOregon\nMassachusetts\nPennsylvania\nWashington's Attorney General Bob Ferguson's office claims the settlement is:\n...in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act....there is no indication in the settlement agreement or elsewhere that any analysis, study or determination was made by the government defendants in consultation with other agencies, before the federal government agreed to lift export controls on the downloadable guns.\nIn fact, the agreement states that it \"does not reflect any agreed-upon purpose other than the desire of the Parties to reach a full and final conclusion of the Action, and to resolve the Action without the time and expense of further litigation.\"\nThe lawsuit also argues the settlement violates the Tenth Amendment by infringing on states' rights to regulate firearms.\nWashington has a robust regulatory system meant to keep firearms out of the hands of dangerous individuals.\nThat system is jeopardized by the Trump Administration's action and will be undermined by the distribution of Defense Distributed's downloadable guns.\nNote that Ferguson forgets that the Tenth Amendment states plainly:\nThe powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\n(emphasis mine)\nSince our founders clearly said that our rights come from our Creator, and the Second Amendment acknowledges that the \"right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed,\" I truly wonder where he gets this idea the state has a right to do just that, infringe on the rights of the people by regulating firearms.\nhe is reading something into it that is simply not there, but that's a Communist ideology you are seeing there, not an American one.\nReason reports on the response of Defense Distributed:\nJosh Blackman, one of Defense Distributed's lawyers, said in an email today that \"The District Court in Washington already approved the settlement.\nThis latest suit is another collateral attack on a rule-making process that began in the Obama Administration.\"\nAs reported yesterday, Defense Distributed is already embroiled in its own lawsuit against New Jersey and Los Angeles over those authorities' threats, and simultaneously is fighting Pennsylvania's request for a temporary restraining order against them.\n(Both those states are also part of today's federal lawsuit filed in the Western District of Washington.)\nWhile the various court filings about this continue to suggest that August 1 is the date on which Defense Distributed will begin distributing the files—which, again, the settlement legally permits them to do—the distribution is already happening.\nCody Wilson of Defense Distributed is already fundraising off the suit via Twitter.\nHe told me five years ago, when I was writing a feature story on the beginnings of his fight with the government over gun-making files, that \"This has been a continuous process of different levels of authority figures trying to stop it from happening and thus allowing it to happen...Of course we are going to succeed—because you all are trying to stop me.\nThat seemed natural and ended up being true.\"\nSo far, that has continued to be true.\nThis federal judge should know what the Constitution actually says and should have tossed this frivolous lawsuit in the trash where it belongs.\nInstead, he is demonstrating he is not even fit to sit on the bench, and the attorney generals of each of these states are demonstrating they are not fit to be in the office they are in.\nSpeaking of Defense Distributed and Cody Wilson, enter to win this Ghost Gunner 2 and make your own guns at home!\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":

Жительница Харькова рассказала «Репортёру» о том, что сейчас происходит в городе — С 5 вечера нет Интернета по всему городу, только мобильный работает. За городом сильно бахает со стороны Салтовки, Алексеевки, ХТЗ. Слышны взрывы на Киевской трассе. Видимо окружают город .  — Это известно из информационных сообщений? — Нет, это мы с балкона слышим. А на украинских каналах ересь. Их сейчас приходится смотреть, потому что Интернета нет нормального. Сказали, что 1 «Джавелином» подбили 15 российских танков под Глуховым. На самом деле 1 БТР подбили, и заправка взорвалась, которая рядом находилась. А все танки прошли, в Чернигове, Сумах, знакомые говорят, уже флаги российские висят. По телевизору говорят, что на Салтовке 5 российских танков подбили. Доказательство — лежащие рядом книги про Новороссию. Прямо-таки российские танкисты возят с собой эти книжки. Постановочные картины для телевидения, я думаю. Зато украинские «Грады» поставили во дворах жилых домов со стороны Волчанска и бьют по россиянам из жилых кварталов.  — Реально ли люди массово прячутся в метро?  — Кто-то прячется. А вообще народ гуляет по городу. Люди с собаками, с детьми, с колясками. Правда в магазинах разобрали все, что можно. Я подумала, не хрен мне делать в метро ночь на холодном полу проводить. А люди с подушками и одеялами пошли.  — Как обстоит ситуация с праворадикалами?  — Нациков не видно и не слышно, они все из Харькова выехали. Все свидомые подрапали. Только из летного училища курсантов погнали, а никаких тербатов не видно. Даже около военкомата пустота. Мне знакомая из-за границы говорит, что все ее подружки в Харькове за Украину. — А где они? — Да все выехали.

A US gun rights advocate began gearing up for a legal fight Wednesday to be able to publish online blueprints for 3D-printed firearms, as the White House signaled support for a federal judge's decision to block the venture.\nEight US states and the District of Columbia have argued in court that the blueprints available online to make untraceable, undetectable plastic weapons like this single-shot \"Liberator\" handgun could fall into the wrong hands\nCody Wilson's Texas-based company Defense Distributed had briefly made the blueprints available online, but Seattle-based US District Judge Robert Lasnik granted an injunction Tuesday to take the material down.\nThe Donald Trump administration last month gave permission for Wilson to publish the blueprints, but the White House said Wednesday the president was unaware of the decision and was glad it was being reviewed.\nEight US states and the District of Columbia sued, arguing the blueprints could allow anyone -- from a teen to a 'lone wolf' gunman -- to make untraceable, undetectable plastic weapons.\nWilson complied with the judge's order, but put out a call for financial support for the legal battle ahead, including a scheduled August 10 court hearing.\nHe told CBS News ahead of the injunction that he believes \"access to firearms is a fundamental human dignity.\nIt's a fundamental human right.\"\n\"What I'm doing is legally protected,\" he said.\n\"I will go to the appellate level.\nI will go to the Supreme Court.\nI will waste all my time.\"\n- President 'glad' for review -\nAs uproar was building Tuesday over Wilson's efforts, the president tweeted that making plastic 3D-printed guns publicly available \"doesn't seem to make much sense.\"\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders elaborated Wednesday, saying the administration's Justice Department had acted on its own in granting Wilson permission to publish the blueprints on his Defcad website -- settling a five-year legal battle.\n\"The Department of Justice made a deal without the president's approval,\" Sanders said.\n\"The president's glad this effort was delayed to give more time to review the issue.\"\nSanders also repeated the administration's claim from a day earlier that existing law already prohibits plastic firearms.\nThe National Rifle Association, the nation's most politically influential gun rights group, echoed that claim, contending that the 1988 law made the current 3D-printed gun issue moot.\n\"Regardless of what a person may be able to publish on the Internet, undetectable plastic guns have been illegal for 30 years,\" the NRA said in a statement.\nBut Wilson has gotten around the legal prohibition by providing instructions with the digital files for 3D printing his \"Liberator\" plastic gun that call for an approximately six-ounce block of steel to be affixed to the weapon.\nShould those who print the gun follow those instructions, metal detectors would pick up the weapons, thus complying with the law.\nBut while users can build the gun, there is no way to ensure they affix metal to it.\n- 'The debate is over' -\nLate Tuesday, dozens of Democratic senators introduced legislation to prohibit the publication of 3D-printable firearm designs, a move gun control groups applauded.\nBut some damage was already done.\nWilson's blueprints had been posted on Defcad before the court order took effect and had already been downloaded thousands of times.\n\"The debate is over.\nThe guns are downloadable.\nThe files are in the public domain -- you cannot take them back,\" Wilson told CBS.\nGun control groups nevertheless were relieved by the judge's decision, with the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence calling 3D-printed firearms \"nothing short of a menace to society.\"\n\"There is simply no way of telling how much damage has already been done by Cody Wilson's dangerous and reckless actions,\" Brady Campaign co-president Kris Brown said in a statement.\n\"This is a strong step and a clear victory for the entire gun safety movement, but we simply can't let up.\"\nPrior to last month, Wilson had actually been losing his drawn-out legal battle, after both a federal district court and an appellate court ruled against him.\nThe US Supreme Court declined to take up his case.\nBut in a sign of his determination to continue the legal fight, a message on the Defense Distributed website made a public appeal for financial support \"to uncensor the site.\"\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Loaded_Language\t3902\t3924\nRepetition\t1130\t1171\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice\t3773\t3798\nLoaded_Language\t3773\t3798\n"}]}

INITIATIVE\n\nOriginally published the Jerusalem Post.\nOn Friday, US President Donald Trump initiated an important change in US policy toward Iran.\n\nNo, in his speech decertifying Iran’s compliance with the nuclear accord it struck with his predecessor Barack Obama, Trump didn’t announce a new strategy for preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, or stemming its hegemonic rise in the Middle East, or limiting its ability to sponsor terrorism.\nTrump’s move was not operational.\nIt was directional.\n\nIn his address Friday, Trump changed the policy dynamics that dictate US policy on Iran.\nFor the first time since 2009, when Obama backed the murderous regime in Tehran, spurning the millions of Iranians who rose up in the Green Revolution, Trump opened up the possibility that the US may begin to base its policies toward Iran on reality.\n\nTrump began his remarks by setting out Iran’s long rap sheet of aggression against America.\n\nStarting with the US embassy seizure and hostage crisis, Trump described Iran’s crimes and acts of war against America in greater detail than any of his predecessors ever did.\n\nTrump’s dossier was interlaced with condemnations of the regime’s repression of its own people.\n\nBy merging Iran’s external aggression with its internal repression, Trump signaled a readiness to drive a wedge – or expand the wedge – between the authoritarian theocrats that rule Iran and the largely secular, multiethnic and pro-Western people of Iran.\n\nTrump then turned his attention to Iran’s illicit ballistic missile program, its sponsorship of terrorism, including its links to al-Qaida, its aggression against its neighbors, its aggressive acts against maritime traffic in the Straits of Hormuz, and its bids to destabilize and control large swaths of the Middle East through its proxies.\n\nIt is notable that these remarks preceded Trump’s discussion of the nuclear deal – which was the ostensible subject of his speech.\nBefore Trump discussed Iran’s breaches of the nuclear deal, he first demonstrated that contrary to the expressed views of his top advisers, it is impossible to limit a realistic discussion of the threat Iran constitutes to US national security and interests to whether or not and it what manner it is breaching the nuclear accord.\n\nThis was a critical point because for the past two years, US discourse on Iran has focused solely on whether or not Iran was complying with Obama’s nuclear pact.\nBy placing the nuclear deal in the context of Iran’s consistent, overarching hostility and aggression, Trump made it self-evident that no US interest is served in continuing to give Iran a free pass from congressional sanctions.\n\nAfter accomplishing that goal, Trump turned his attention to how Iran is actually breaching the letter and spirit of the nuclear pact.\nOnly then, almost as an afterthought, did he announce that he was decertifying Iranian compliance with the nuclear deal, setting the conditions for the renewal of congressional sanctions on Iran and opening the floodgates of congressional sanctions on Iran in retaliation for the full spectrum of its aggressive and illicit acts against the US, its interests and allies.\n\nBy empowering Congress to prohibit economic cooperation with Iran, Trump put the Europeans, Chinese and Russians on notice that they may soon face a choice between conducting business with the US and conducting business with Iran.\n\nAfter putting them on notice, Trump discussed the possibility of improving Obama’s nuclear accord.\nAmong other things, he suggested expanding the inspection regime against Iran’s nuclear installations and canceling the so-called “sunset” clause that places an end date on the restrictions governing certain components of Iran’s nuclear advancement.\n\nTrump’s address has the potential to serve as the foundation of a major, positive shift in US policy toward Iran.\nSuch a shift could potentially facilitate the achievement of Trump’s goals of preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, containing its regional aggression and empowerment and defeating its terrorist proxies.\n\nUnfortunately, it is also likely, indeed, it is more likely, that his words will not be translated into policies to achieve these critical aims.\n\nTrump’s decision to transfer immediate responsibility to Congress for holding Iran accountable for its hostile actions on the military and other fronts is a risky move.\nHe has a lot of enemies, and the nuclear deal has a lot of supporters on Capitol Hill.\n\nObama would have never been able to implement his nuclear deal if Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, hadn’t agreed to cast the Constitution aside and ignore Obama’s constitutional duty to present the nuclear deal to the Senate for ratification as a treaty.\n\nOver the past week, Trump and Corker have been involved in an ugly public fight precipitated by Corker’s announcement that he will not be seeking reelection next year.\n\nToday Corker has nothing to restrain him from scuttling Trump’s agenda.\nIf he wishes, out of spite, Corker can block effective sanctions from being passed.\nAnd he may do so even though the implications for his Senate colleagues would be dire and even though doing so would render him an unofficial protector of Iran’s nuclear program.\n\nWhat is true for Corker is doubly true for the Democrats.\n\nLeading Democratic senators like Robert Menendez, Ben Cardin and Chuck Schumer, who opposed Obama’s Iran deal may now feel that as opponents of the Trump administration, they are required to oppose any change to the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act.\n\nIndeed, given the rise of radical forces in their party it is likely that they would rather give Iran a free pass for its anti-American aggression and nuclear proliferation than work with Republicans on Capitol Hill and in the White House.\n\nThen again, by framing the issue of Iran’s threat to America as he did, and by transferring responsibility for reinstating sanctions and passing further sanctions on Iran to Congress, Trump opened up the possibility that Congress will conduct substantive – rather than personal – debates on Iran.\n\nAnd the more substantive those debates become, the further away the US discourse will move from the mendacious assumptions of Obama’s Iran policy – that the Iranian regime is a responsible actor and potential US ally, and that there is nothing inherently aggressive or problematic about Iran’s illicit nuclear weapons program.\n\nThe second major risk inherent in Trump’s approach is that he will get his way; that the Europeans, Russians and Chinese and the Iranians will agree to improve the nuclear deal.\nThe problem here is not obvious.\nClearly, it is better if the deal is amended to delete the sunset clauses and expand the inspections regime.\n\nYet even an amended, improved deal will still serve as a shield to Iran’s nuclear program.\nAn improved deal won’t destroy Iran’s centrifuges.\n\nIt won’t take away Iran’s enriched uranium.\nIt won’t destroy Iran’s nuclear installations.\nAnd it won’t bring down the regime which by its nature ensures all of these things will remain a menace to the US, its allies and international security as a whole.\n\nSo long as the US continues to maintain a policy based on the false view that all that is necessary to destroy the threat of a nuclear armed Iran is a combination of the nuclear deal and economic sanctions, it will continue to ensure that Iran and its nuclear program remain a major threat.\nDistressingly, US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, the most outspoken supporter of decertifying Iranian compliance in the Trump administration, told NBC on Sunday that the US intends to remain in the nuclear deal.\n\nTo understand what must be done we must return to Trump’s speech and its strategic significance.\n\nBy taking a holistic view of the Iranian threat – grounded in a recognition of the inherent hostility of the regime – Trump opened up the possibility that the US and its allies can develop a holistic policy for confronting and defeating Iran and its proxies.\nIf the Iran deal and sanctions are two components to a larger strategy rather than the entire strategy, they can be helpful.\n\nA wider strategy would target Iran’s regional aggression by weakening its proxies and clients from Hezbollah and Hamas to the regimes in Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Lebanon.\nIt would target the regime itself by empowering the ayatollahs’ domestic opponents.\nIt would pin down Iranian forces by arming and otherwise assisting the Iraqi Kurds to defend and maintain their control over their territory along the Iranian border while strengthening the ties between Iranian Kurds and Iraqi Kurds.\n\nFriday, Trump created the possibility for such a strategy.\nIt is up to members of Congress, and US allies like Israel and the Sunni Arab states to help Trump conceive and implement it.\nIf they fail, the possibility Trump created will be lost, perhaps irrevocably.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":

Действительно, все озвученные проблемы имеют место быть. К сожалению, новая операционная среда национальной безопасности делается не только святым гиперзвуком, ударными бпла и танком Армата. Российские вооружённые силы только начали входить в эпоху войн 6-го поколения. Это не говоря о войнах нового и новейшего поколения. Скажем так, многие аспекты новой операционной среды национальной безопасности в нашем государстве ещё концептуально не осмыслены, а без этого невозможно формирование военно-технической и научной политики по этому направлению. Частный случай, это широкополосная спутниковая связь и подключение к ней каждой боевой единицы. Да, у Роскосмоса есть проект Сфера, ну этот спутниковый интернет как аналог проекта Илона Маска, но в армии нет концепции, как этот проект использовать в среде новой операционной безопасности, а что самое главное, как должна в связи с реализацией этого проекта измениться научная и технологическая политика, на основе которой должны создаваться новые образцы вооружения и военной техники отвечающие условиям ведения войны от 6-го поколения и выше. Эти вопросы решались, но они решались слишком медленно, так как в государстве на уровне политической власти в этом отношении была некая инерция мышления. Теперь Россия вступила в новую геополитическую реальность и политическая власть будет вынуждена менять свое отношение и к этому вопросу. Ну а мы как производители и разработчики оборонных систем, постараемся подсказать нашему государству наиболее удобный путь к построения новой операционной среды национальной безопасности. Надеюсь, у нас получится взаимодействие и сотрудничество с нашей политической властью по данному направлению... https://t.me/swodki/24781"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "no propaganda detected"}]}

Keith Ellison of domestic abuse said on Monday that Democrats don’t believe her story and threatened to isolate her over the allegations.\nKaren Monahan, a former girlfriend, came forward last month alleging that Ellison sent her threatening text messages and once screamed obscenities at her as he dragged her off a bed by her feet.\nEllison has denied the accusations, saying he “never behaved this way.” He did acknowledge he was in a relationship with the woman.\nThe allegations didn’t lead to any immediate action against the congressman, except for the announcement that the Democratic National Committee (DNC) would review the accusations.\nHe went on to win the Democratic primary election for Minnesota attorney general.\nMonahan slammed the Democratic Party for its response to her allegations when compared to its treatment of Christine Blasey Ford.\nFord has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of attempting to force himself onto her during at a high school party nearly four decades ago, prompting prominent Democrats to get behind Ford’s allegations.\n“No, they don’t,” Monahan tweeted in response to a question whether the party believes women’s stories.\n“I’ve been smeared, threatened, isolated from my own party.\nI provided medical records from 2017, stating on two different Dr.\nVisits, I told them about the abuse and who did it.\nMy therapist released records stating I have been dealing and healing from the abuse.” She added: “Four people, including my supervisor at the time, stated that I came to them after and shared the exact story I shared publicly, I shared multiple text between me and Keith, where I discuss the abuse with him and much more.\nAs I said before, I knew I wouldn’t be believed.” Her comment came after another user pointed to comments made by Peter Daou, a Democratic strategist and former advisor to Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, who wrote in a tweet that the Kavanaugh accuser will be “attacked, smeared, and demonized” and that people must “believe women.” Many other Democrats and progressives – who stayed silent when the accusations against Ellison emerged – came out in support of Ford, including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Tom Perez, chairman of the DNC, who urged to investigate the claims and Kavanaugh.\nMonahan went to reiterate that her story has nothing to do with politics.\n“I have nothing to prove to anyone, I simply shared my story.\nPeople can believe it or not.\nI don’t need anyone to affirm my humanity, I affirmed it,” she wrote in another tweet.\n“The fact that both parties only care if it scores political points is hypocritical,” she added.\n“Do you think a person who has dealt with any form of abuse by politicians is thinking about politics?\nNo, we & are families are trying to heal.”\nArticle posted with permission from Pamela Geller\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Loaded_Language\t3288\t3297\nLoaded_Language\t310\t368\nSlogans\t3320\t3336\n"}]}

Barack Obama (D) and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan that he took in 2005 at a Congressional Black Caucus meeting, but did not make public because he believed it would have “made a difference” to Obama’s political future.\nThe photographer, Askia Muhammad, told the Trice Edney News Wire that he “gave the picture up at the time and basically swore secrecy.” “But after the nomination was secured and all the way up until the inauguration; then for eight years after he was President, it was kept under cover,” Muhammad said.\nAsked whether he thought the photo’s release would have affected Obama’s presidential campaign, Muhammad said, “I insist.\nIt absolutely would have made a difference.” Reached by TPM on Thursday, Muhammad said a “staff member” for the CBC contacted him “sort of in a panic” after he took the photo at a caucus meeting in 2005.\nTPM has published the photo above with Muhammad’s permission.\n“I sort of understood what was going on,” Muhammad told TPM.\n“I promised and made arrangements to give the picture to Leonard Farrakhan,” the minister’s son-in-law and chief of staff.\nMuhammad said he gave away “the disk” from his camera but “copied the photograph from that day onto a file” on his computer.\n“Realizing that I had given it up, I mean, it was sort of like a promise to keep the photograph secret,” Muhammad said.\nMuhammad said he did not release his copy of the photograph because he thought it would be perceived as a betrayal of that promise: “I was really, I guess, afraid of them.”\nMalcolm X wasn’t adequately afraid of them.\nHere’s what happened to him:\nhttps://youtu.be/qSm1t3Uv9QI\nMuhammad said he thought the photograph would be “damaging politically” if it were released and was afraid that someone might “break into his apartment” looking for it, like “that Watergate crap.” He said he “felt a little bit more at ease” after Farrakhan in 2016 claimed that Obama visited his home in Chicago.\nMuhammad contacted Farrakhan in autumn 2017 with the “final manuscript” for a self-published book containing the photo.\n“I sent him a copy of the manuscript suggesting that, showing him the picture, and saying to him, if he did not object, I was going to publish it,” Muhammad said.\n“He had no objection.” … During Obama’s presidential campaign, conservatives pushed multiple apparently racially motivated conspiracy theories about Obama’s religion and supposed ties to Islam.\nFor example, in Obama’s memoir subtitled A Story of Race and Inheritance, Obama recounts his being a regular reader of Minister Farrakhan’s Nation of Islam newspaper The Final Call.\nObama recollects Farrakhan’s black nationalist capitalist campaign to get black people to use toothpaste manufactured by black-owned businesses.\nFarrakhan’s eventual failure suggests to Obama that’s there is more economic upside for blacks in shaking down white institutions than in building their own.\nDuring the 2008 presidential election, conservatives questioned the indirect ties between Farrakhan and Obama, who attended a church that gave Farrakhan an award.\nObama’s “spiritual advisor” Rev.\nJeremiah Wright gave Farrakhan his church’s Lifetime Achievement award in a downtown Chicago Hyatt Regency in November 2007, but the story didn’t make the press until the following year.\nSimilarly, very little media attention was paid to the close relationship between Obama’s fundraiser and private mentor Tony Rezko and the Nation of Islam, even though Rezko’s role was business manager for Nation of Islam assets, such as the career of Muhammad Ali.\nBut after all, what could be more boring than a story than involves a Presidential candidate, the Syrian Christian crook who helped him buy his house, the Nation of Islam, and the most famous boxer of all time?\nReading Obama’s 1995 memoir, you might almost get the impression that after a prudent first term, during his second he might side with, I dunno, Black Lives Matter and encourage a wave of black rage and police retreat that drove up the death toll from murder by 20% in his last two years in office, an incremental death toll a little bigger than the U.S. combat death toll from the equally stupid Iraq War.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Loaded_Language\t3081\t3113\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice\t1962\t2033\nLoaded_Language\t4189\t4200\nRepetition\t2959\t2964\nDoubt\t4001\t4406\nLoaded_Language\t2056\t2060\nName_Calling,Labeling\t3313\t3330\nLoaded_Language\t1027\t1045\n"}]}

Dr. Paul Craig Roberts Best Price: $11.96 Buy New $19.34 (as of 10:15 EDT - Details) From here relations between the two nuclear powers deteriorated rapidly.\nAs I and Stephen Cohen have emphasized, the danger of nuclear war is today far higher than ever during the long Cold War as there is today no trust whatsoever between the two governments.\nDonald Trump is totally correct that nuclear war would be a terminable event and that nothing is more important than restoring a cooperative and mutually respectful relationship between the US and Russia.\nThe problem is that the military/security complex sees it differently.\nAfter 70 years of entrenchment the military/security complex is an independent political force.\nPresident Eisenhower warned the American people about this likely outcome in 1961 to no avail.\nFrom the standpoint of the military/security complex, the problem of normalizing relations with Russia is that it downgrades the “Russian threat” that is so essential to the $1,000 billion annual budget of the military/security complex and the power that such a massive budget conveys.\nOnly 16 countries in the world out of 195 countries have a GDP greater than $1,000 billion.\nThe military/security complex is large enough to be a member of the G-20 and to have its own currency and military.\nObama’s CIA director, John Brennan, quickly organized the Russiagate conspiracy against Trump.\nComey, Rosenstein, Clapper, Mueller, McCabe, Peter Strzok and others were, and are, apparently implicated as active participants in orchestrating an alleged collusion between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin to steal the US presidential election.\nBased on deception of the FISA Court, warrants were illegally obtained that became the basis for appointing Mueller as a special prosecutor to construct by whatever means possible a case against President Trump.\nAfter two years the only evidence we have of Russiagate is that it is a conspiracy against President Trump and the American people.\nIndeed, Mueller, fully aware that there was no Trump-Putin conspiracy, has not bothered to look for any evidence as there can be no evidence of something that did not happen.\nHe pulled out of a hat some phony and meaningless indictments of some Russians in order to make it look like there was a conspiracy without having to prove it, but his main focus has been on framing Paul Manafort.\nMueller’s investigation of Manafort has nothing to do with the Russiagate story line.\nManafort’s alleged crimes are far outside Mueller’s mandate and took place, if they did, years before the alleged events of Russiagate.\nManafort’s conviction by a jury on 8 of the 18 counts is being misrepresented by the Trump-hating presstitutes as vindication of the Russiagate investigation and as “A dark day for Trump,” with the presstitutes suggesting a Watergate parallel that will force Trump from office.\nManafort was found guilty not of Russiagate, but of income tax evasion and misrepresenting his financial position on a loan application.\nWe do not know if Manafort is guilty or is simply a victim of Mueller’s frameup and an incompetent jury.\nAmerican juries are notoriously incompetent, which is why 97% of felony indictments are settled with a plea bargain.\nEven the innocent had rather work out a plea arrangement and admit to something that they did not do than to face an insouciant American jury.\nRemember the jury that condemned the survivors of the FBI’s massacre of the Branch Davidians in Waco, Texas, to be locked away for many years so that they could not talk and tell of the mass murder inflicted on a religious group by the FBI.\nIt is unclear how much of a crime it can be to misrepresent your financial position on a loan application when one of the causes of the mortgage-backed derivative crisis was the misrepresentation of mortgage applicants on the loan documents by the companies issuing the mortgages.\nInstead of prosecution, Washington relied on the Federal Reserve to bail out the banks holding the misrepresented loans.\nIncome tax invasion is the purview of the IRS, not of a special prosecutor who is supposed to be looking for evidence of a Trump-Putin conspiracy.\nThe Russia Hoax: The I... Gregg Jarrett Best Price: $13.99 Buy New $12.63 (as of 08:40 EDT - Details)\nSo, why did Mueller focus on Manafort?\nLet Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz tell you:\n“All the Special Counsel needs, in order to charge a subject of an investigation with lying to a prosecutor, is a single witnesses willing to contradict the subject.\n“The witness may not only be “singing,” he may also be “composing” — that is, making up or embellishing a story because he knows that the better his story, the better the deal.\n“Under federal law, the testimony of such a “flipped witness” need not be corroborated in order to secure a conviction.\n“Even one question that results in an answer that is contradicted by one witness would be enough to spring the perjury trap.”\nPresident Trump has made various statements disputing the orchestrated Russiagate accusations that, if Manafort as witness for the Special Prosecutor contradicted, could send the President of the United States to prison for perjury.\nKnowing this, Mueller, in my opinion a proven corrupt person, decided to put the squeeze on Manafort in order to force Manafort to save himself by giving false testimony against Trump.\nThis tactic is used every day by state, local, and federal prosecutors.\nAmericans who believe the indictments and convictions are unaware that 97% of the time the convictions rest on self-incrimination in order to avoid worse punishment.\nIn Manafort’s case it didn’t, or hasn’t, worked.\nYet.\nManafort is due for a second trial, this time for allegely acting as an unregistered foreign agent for Ukrainian interests and for making false statements not under oath to the US government.\nReportedly, Manafort is being held in solitary confinement, a form of torture designed to break a person’s spirit.\nLike Manafort’s first trial, his second trial has nothing whatsoever to do with Russiagate, but you will never learn that from the presstitute media or from the Democratic Party.\nManafort can still be coerced to say something that can be used to drive Trump from office.\nWhat about Michael Cohen, a former attorney for Trump?\nMueller saw no value in the Cohen case and passed it off to a regular US attorney to prosecute.\nTherefore, it would appear not to be part of the Russiagate investigation.\nCohen avoided a jury and said he was guilty of five counts of personal income tax evasion, one count of making a false statement to a financial institution in order to get a loan, and two counts related to illegal campaign contributions.\nWith regard to the campagin contributions, he contradicted his previous statements.\nHe said that on Trump’s instruction, he paid off two women who were claiming sexual affairs with Trump.\nThe intricacies of American laws relating to politics are often unclear.\nApparently, the charge is that Cohen used monies raised for a political campaign to pay off two women, who saw and capitalized on an opportunity to extort Trump for money, and this was an illegal use of the money.\nWhy a lawyer would pay off women, whose stories might or might not be true, in an illegal way when his client is a multi-billionaire doesn’t make much sense.\nBut these are not the kind of questions that the presstitutes are interested in.\nNevertheless, Cohen’s plea is associated with a case brought by another prosecutor, not by Special Prosecutor Mueller.\nI am not sufficiently familiar with US legal procedures to be able to say how this gets brought back into Mueller’s investigation.\nThe facts are this:\nThe US military/security complex will not permit any normalization of relations with Russia.\nPeriod.\nAt some point Putin and Lavrov and the idiot Russian Atlanticist Integrationists will have to acknowledge this fact, or Russia will be destroyed.\nTrump, by declaring normalization of relations as one of his two principal goals for his presidency, earned the emnity of the powerful military/security complex.\nBy defeating Hillary for the presidency, Trump inflamed the US media’s hatred, committed as the presstitutes are to Identity Politics and hatred of the “white male oppressors” who elected Trump.\nTrump will never be forgiven for preventing the election of the first female president of the United States, an unpardonable crime by a misogynist white male who “grabs women by the pussy.”\nThe hatred of Trump by the military/security complex and by the white male hating Identity Politics of the Democratic Party is giving the world the spectacle of an American democratic presidential election being overthrown by a conspiracy between the military/security complex, the Democratic Party, and the whores who constitute the American print and TV media.\nDeath of a Nation: Pla... Dinesh D'Souza Best Price: $14.99 Buy New $16.99 (as of 03:35 EDT - Details)\nPresident Trump stands up for himself on Twitter — I am surprised that Tritter hasn’t suspended his account — but otherwise seems powerless.\nWhoever advised Trump to appoint Rosenstein, a person committed to Trump’s destruction, as deputy attorney general, which is the ruling position in view of the weak and stupid AG Sessions who recused himself from the Russiagate investigation, intended Trump’s destruction.\nA disreputable person committed to Trump’s destruction is appointed by Trump to destroy Trump.\nHow can a person so unclued survive?\nAs I wrote during the presidential campaign, Trump has no idea of Washington and no idea who to appoint who would support him rather than work against him.\nConsequently, he has a government working against him.\nSenators John McCain and Lindsey Graham are working to prevent the Republican Party from supporting the party’s president.\nThey could easily succeed.\nThe entirety of the House and Senate of both parties is in thrall to the campaign donations of the military/security complex.\nWhat can President Trump do?\nHe could fight, not with words on Twitter, but with the powers of the presidency.\nThere is far more evidence that Russiagate is a conspiracy against the President of the United States than there is evidence that it is a Trump-Putin conspiracy to steal the election from Hillary.\nIf Mueller can indict on the basis of no evidence, Trump can order the Attorney General to indict on the basis of massive evidence that Russiagate is a conspiracy against the President of the United States.\nBrennan, Comey, Clapper, Mueller, Rosenstein, McCabe, Strzok, CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, NPR, the New York Times, Washington Post, et.\nal., are all members of the conspiracy to overthrow democracy in America and establish the undisputed rule of the military/security complex.\nThe idiot presstitutes’ hatred of Trump might leave them unaware of the conspiracy in which they are participating, but there is no doubt that the American presstitutes are engaged in the overthrow of American democracy, however little of American democracy still exists.\nThis column is not an endorsement of Trump.\nIt is an endorsement of truth, and it is an endorsement of the American people who in their distress and with the best information that they could acquire elected Donald Trump their President.\nTrump is wrong on the environment.\nEnvironmental protections put in place after years of struggle are being eviscerated by industry polluters who have gained controll over the environmental regulatory agencies.\nThis is not a unique happening of the Trump presidency.\nIt began under VP Dick Cheney, the real president during the 8 years of the George W. Bush regime.\nCheney turned the environmental protection regulatory agencies over to industry polluters.\nTrump is wrong on Iran.\nHe is in Israel’s hands, hoping that the power of the Israel Lobby can shield him from the presstitutes and the military/security complex.\nWhat Israel is doing by attempting to use US military force against Iran is unifying a new alliance that is too powerful for the Washington/Israeli alliance.\nRussia, China, Syria, Turkey, Iran, India, and Pakistan are the locations of populations that massively outnumber Washington’s empire.\nEach of these countries are being united by Washington’s stupid and inexplicable actions against each.\nMilitarily, Israel is of no consequence.\nTwice the vaunted Israeli Army, capable of nothing but murdering unarmed women and children, were defeated and driven out of southern Lebanon by a few thousand Hezbollah militia.\nIsrael is too cowardly to try it a third time, and is relying on the stupid Americans to do the job for them.\nThe entire world looks at America and Israel, and what does the world see?\nTwo countries, both the result of exterminating the native populations, distrusted and universally hated, both of which survive by purhasing the governments of other countries and by endless lies that describe everyone but themselves and their vassals as evil criminals that must be destroyed.\nFor example, the Gaza Strip, the largest concentration camp ever in the world, is being systematically destroyed along with all life within it by Israel under cover of the obvious and transparanent lie that all within Gaza are terrorists outfitted with bomb belts who are committed to the destruction of Israel.\nNot only men of fighting age, but also old men, pregnant women, children, all Palestinians are being murdered by the Israeli military.\nThe United States Secretary of State agrees with Israel that all Palestinians must be destroyed, the sooner the better.\nThe Chinese are busy taking advantage of the financial opportunities that the idiot Americans forfeit, but otherwise do not seem to have any strategic sense of how to proceed in the drama unfolding in front of their eyes.\nFor China, money is now all.\nThe Russians are infected with the American propaganda infused into their veins during the Yeltsin era when Russia was an American puppet state.\nSlowly, if not surely, the Russians are coming to their senses and realizing that they have no American “partner.”\nIf Trump is defeated and moved off the table, what happens when Russia and China finally realize that there is to be no conciliation with Washington?\nWhen all the false hopes and bets of the Russian and Chinese governments of conciliation on the basis of mutual economic interests come to naught, what happens?\nIt will be the end of life on earth.\nThe Russiagate “investigation” appears to be timed to influence the midterm elections with unsubstantiated accusations made just before the elections in an attempt to produce a Democratic Congress that would impeach President Trump on false charges.\nThe presstitutes would cover up the frameup.\nIn other words, the real election meddling is being done by the Russiagate “investigation.” See here and here.\nSuch an impeachment would be a coup.\nThe consequence would be deep and permanent divisions in American political life and more rabid Russiaphobia that would result in war.\nThe danger is real that the Democrats’ Russiagate “investigation” aided and abetted by the presstitute media will result in nuclear Armageddon.\nThe Best of Paul Craig

information suggests that the officer arrived home in full uniform after working a full shift.\nThe officer reported to the responding officers that she entered the victim’s apartment believing that it was her own.\nAt some point, the officer fired her weapon striking the victim.\nResponding officers administered aid to the victim, a 26-year-old male, at the scene.\nThe victim was then transported to the hospital and pronounced deceased.\nNext of kin notification has not been made at this time.\nThe officer was not injured and will be placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation.\nThe Dallas Police Department is conducting a joint investigation with the District Attorney’s Office.\nThis investigation is ongoing and we will release additional details as they become available and it is appropriate to do so.\nI have no idea how you can enter an apartment mistakenly.\nDoes Guyger leave her door unlocked?\nFurthermore, The Dallas News reports:\nJean, who lived on the fourth floor of the South Side Flats in the Cedars, was home alone when Guyger mistook his apartment for hers, the affidavit says.\nGuyger lived on the third floor, directly beneath his apartment, and mistakenly parked on the fourth floor after finishing a shift at the Dallas Police Department, the affidavit says.\nWhen she arrived at Jean's door, Guyger entered a unique door key with an electronic chip into the keyhole, the affidavit says.\nThe door was already ajar, so the force of pushing the key inside opened the door, according to the affidavit.\nThe affidavit says the apartments' \"respective interior floorplans are in most ways identical or extremely similar.\"\nThe apartment was dark and when she saw \"a large silhouette,\" Guyger thought she was being burglarized, the affidavit says.\nThe affidavit says Guyger drew her gun, \"gave verbal commands that were ignored\" and fired twice.\nJean was struck once in the torso.\nGuyger then called 911 from her cellphone and started performing first aid.\nShe turned on the lights, then went to the front door again and realized the apartment wasn't hers, the affidavit says.\nShe told the 911 operator as well as responding officers that she thought she was at her apartment when she shot Jean, according to the affidavit.\nOk, some of this seems plausible, but I still am left wondering about the door being ajar.\nIs this something people are prone to do at 1o o'clock at night in Dallas?\nIn any case, we all know that any of us who did the same thing would have immediately been taken into custody.\nThis was not the case with Guyger, though one officer close to her said, \"she is devastated.\"\nKnowing this provoked outrage across the nation over the weekend.\nIn fact, this is not her first shooting.\nAs a four-year veteran of the force, she was also involved in the shooting of another suspect in 2017.\nThe Dallas News reported:\nIn 2017, Guyger shot 47-year-old Uvaldo Perez, who had wrestled a Taser away from her.\nAnother officer had been in a Pleasant Grove neighborhood looking for a woman who had a warrant out for her arrest.\nWhen the officer thought he saw the woman in a car with two men in the 8300 block of Reva Street, the officer asked for backup from Guyger and another officer, according to an affidavit.\nOne of the officers was trying to search Perez when he became combative, the affidavit said.\nGuyger deployed her Taser before Perez was able to take it from her.\nAfter Perez had the Taser, Guyger fired her gun once, striking him in the abdomen, the affidavit said.\nNeither Guyger nor the other officers were injured in the 2017 shooting.\nPolice arrested Perez on a charge of taking a weapon from an officer, as well as charges for possession of methamphetamine, marijuana and violating his parole.\nIn February 2018, Perez signed a plea agreement for the charge of taking an officer's weapon and was sentenced to two years in prison.\nThe Texas Rangers are also involved in the investigation.\nUSA Today reports that Guyger was freed on bail on Sunday after being charged with manslaughter, and faces two 20-year sentences and up to a $10,000 fine.\nA charge of murder may be forthcoming once the case is taken to a grand jury, according to Dallas County District Attorney Faith Johnson.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":

John McCain (R-Ariz.) said Americans need answers about her past involvement in state sponsored torture programs.\nAs I noted earlier today, Haspel’s long career at the CIA spanned the years of torture carried out under the George W. Bush White House.\nA 2013 Washington Post report on the new CIA head called her role in the torture programs of that era “extensive” and noted that at one point she ran a CIA “black site” in Thailand where torture occurred.\nIn a lengthy statement following Haspel’s nomination, McCain expressed big concerns about what it means for the agency’s future, saying:\nDuring his own confirmation proceedings for Director of the CIA, Mike Pompeo repeatedly committed that he would comply with the law that applies the Army Field Manual’s interrogation requirements to all U.S. agencies, including the CIA.\nThe American people now deserve the same assurances from Gina Haspel, whose career with the agency has intersected with the program of so-called ‘enhanced interrogation techniques’ on a number of occasions.\nThe torture of detainees in U.S. custody during the last decade was one of the darkest chapters in American history.\nMs. Haspel needs to explain the nature and extent of her involvement in the CIA’s interrogation program during the confirmation process.\nI know the Senate will do its job in examining Ms. Haspel’s record as well as her beliefs about torture and her approach to current law.\nIn the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, our government squandered precious moral authority in a futile effort to produce intelligence by means of torture.\nWe are still dealing with the consequences of that desperately misguided decision.\nCurrent U.S. law is clear in banning enhanced interrogation techniques.\nAny nominee for Director of the CIA must pledge without reservation to uphold this prohibition, which has helped us to regain our position of leadership in the struggle for universal human rights—the struggle upon which this country was founded, and which remains its highest aspiration.\nAmericans who value the Constitution should take this rare moment to agree with McCain.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Loaded_Language\t0\t6\nLoaded_Language\t1747\t1761\nLoaded_Language\t1857\t1888\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice\t2249\t2337\nAppeal_to_Authority\t516\t633\nLoaded_Language\t1320\t1368\nFlag-Waving\t2249\t2337\nFlag-Waving\t2157\t2249\n"}]}

Everyone: Soon Those Who Hate Freedom Will Have Unquestioned Access to the Minds of 2 Billion People\n\nYesterday, the alternative media purge was boldly advanced in a coordinated effort to silence people who dissent from establishment views.\nIt’s just one more step toward a monopoly on information by those who hate freedom.\nAt this rate, they’ll soon have unquestioned access to the minds of more than 2 billion people.\nAnd this should terrify everyone who wants to be free to question the status quo and to seek a wide range of information.\nHundreds of alternative media site administrators logged onto Facebook to discover that their accounts had been removed.\nSoon after, many of these sites and their writers found that their Twitter accounts had also been suspended.\nPopular pages like The AntiMedia (2.1 million fans), The Free Thought Project (3.1 million fans), Press for Truth (350K fans), Police the Police (1.9 million fans), Cop Block (1.7 million fans), and Punk Rock Libertarians (125K fans) are just a few of the ones which were unpublished.\nWhy were these alternative media accounts removed?\ntake our poll - story continues below\nWho should

free of charge.\nYou may opt out at anytime.\nYou also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\nThe reason given doesn’t really add up.\nFacebook told the LA Times that these pages had violated the company’s spam policies.\n“Today, we’re removing 559 Pages and 251 accounts that have consistently broken our rules against spam and coordinated inauthentic behavior,” the company said in a blog post.\n“People will only share on Facebook if they feel safe and trust the connections they make here.” (source)\nBut this isn’t actually what their spam policy says.\nHere’s the policy.\nWe work hard to limit the spread of commercial spam to prevent false advertising, fraud, and security breaches, all of which detract from people’s ability to share and connect.\nWe do not allow people to use misleading or inaccurate information to collect likes, followers, or shares.\nDo Not: Artificially increase distribution for financial gain\nCreate or use fake accounts or compromise other people’s accounts to\nImpersonate or pretend to be a business, organization, public figure, or private individual\nAttempt to create connections, create content, or message people\nRestrict access to

information by:\nAttempting to gather or share login credentials or personally identifiable information\nUsing another person’s login credentials or personally identifiable information\nPromise non-existent Facebook features (source)\nThe Washington Post originally said that these pages were purged for “pushing political messages for profit” as you can see by their URL:\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/10/11/facebook-purged-over-accounts-pages-pushing-political-messages-profit/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.fa1a364488b3\nBut of course, since they too push political messages for profit (waaah, Trump!)\nas do all the other corporate media outlets out there, they changed their headline to “Facebook purged over 800 U.S. accounts and pages for pushing political spam.”\nThe fact that many of these accounts were also suspended by Twitter shortly thereafter should tell you that this is a coordinated effort to silence large swaths of the population.\nOf course, the best coverage of this is from…Russia.\nSputnik News contacted many of the alternative journalists who were purged to get their take on what happened.\nYou may recall that basically every blogger outside the establishment media was accused of being secretly Russian during the 2016 election by the Washington Post, so perhaps actual Russians have a vested interest in the truth coming out on this topic.\nMy friend John Vibes is an amazing person who contributes to The Free Thought Project.\nHe said:\nThis signifies a re-consolidation of the media.\nCable news media controlled the narrative for most of modern history, but the internet has lowered that barrier to entry and allowed the average person to become the media themselves.\nThis obviously took market share and influence away from the traditional media, and it has allowed for a more diverse public conversation.\nNow it seems the platforms that have monopolized the industry are favoring mainstream sources and silencing alternative voices.\nSo now, instead of allowing more people to have a voice, these platforms are creating an atmosphere where only powerful media organizations are welcome, just as we had on cable news.\nPeople think that we are just providing an activist spin on the news, but they don’t see the families struggling to have their voice heard.\nFor example, when someone is shot by police, mainstream media sources often just republish the press release from the police department, without presenting the victim’s side of the story.\nWe give the victims and their families a voice, which is essential to keep power in check.\nThis also goes for bigger issues like foreign policy as well; multiple full-scale invasions of Syria have been prevented because of information that the alternative media made viral.\n(source)\nNicholas Bernabe of The AntiMedia is another alternative journalist I consider a friend and support wholeheartedly.\nHe’s worked tirelessly to be a voice of truth in a world of lies.\nHe told Sputnik:\nOur approach generally is to cover stories and angles that corporate media underreport or misreport and to amplify activist and anti-war voices and stories.\nAll of our content is professionally fact-checked and edited.\nI got into this line of work because I felt there was a need for media that challenged mainstream assumptions and biases in politics.\nI wanted to shed light on corruption and wrongdoing against oppressed peoples and cover the harsh truth about American foreign policy.\nOver the last 28 days, we reached 7,088,000 people on Facebook.\nThe timing of this purge is rather dubious in my view, coming shortly before the midterm elections.\nThis could be an attempt by Facebook itself to affect the outcome of the coming elections.\nThe Twitter suspension caught me by surprise.\nI can only speculate that these suspensions were a coordinated effort to stifle our message ahead of the coming elections.\n(source)\nRemember, this is coordinated, across multiple platforms.\nRemember when this happened to Alex Jones?\nBack in September, an assault was led by YouTube, Google, and Facebook against Alex Jones of Infowars fame.\nAll of his accounts were shut down in quick succession, followed by his credit card processing companies and his newsletter service providers.\nI wrote at the time, “Alex Jones is just the beginning of this purge.\nIt’s going to get much worse.”\nMeanwhile, other dissenting voices were being silenced on social media with limited reach and “shadow banning.”\nInfowars is a massive profit machine.\nBut what happens when similar attacks are launched on smaller alternative media outlets?\nIt hits us right in the wallet.\nAnd if they’re hit hard enough, they’ll cease to be able to function.\nJones has a lot of money so this may not be the end of him, but for most website owners, this would be the absolute end of our ability to do business.\nAnd to be able to bring the information we bring, we do have to run our websites as businesses.\nIt’s far more expensive than most people realize to run a site.\nI know that my own operating costs every month are more than $2000.\nA site as big as Jones’s would be many times that amount.\nWhen all your avenues of monetization are cut off, it wouldn’t be hard for a site – and the dissent and information they share – to cease to exist.\n(source)\nThis is not just about Facebook or Twitter.\nIt’s about the ability to find dissenting information, period.\nGoogle is in on it too.\nA leaked document from Google supported the idea of censorship.\nAnother Google document has found its way into the public domain, this time through Breitbart.\nThe news publication reports that an 85-page briefing entitled “The Good Censor,” advises tech companies to “police tone instead of content” and to not “take sides” when censoring users… Google might continue to shift with the times – changing its stance on how much or how little it censors (due to public, governmental or commercial pressures).\nIf it does, acknowledgment of what this shift in position means for users and for Google is essential.\nShifting blindly or silently in one direction or another rightly incites users’ fury… The Google “internal research” even quotes outside experts like George Soros who express justification of censorship in non-U.S. markets, noting that Google should police “tone instead of content” and “censor everyone equally,” as Breitbart put it.\n(source)\nThere are 2 trillion Google searches per day.\nPER.\nDAY.\nThat should give you an idea of the power of something like Google.\nCombine it with billions of Facebook and Twitter users and you can easily see the influence wielded here.\nThis is where free thought goes to die.\nRon Paul reminds us that truth is treason.\nRon Paul, former senator and the libertarian voice of reason, said when Jones was purged:\n“You get accused of treasonous activity and treasonous speech because in an empire of lies the truth is treason,” Paul told the Russia-based news outlet.\n“Challenging the status quo is what they can’t stand and it unnerves them, so they have to silence people.” “Some of us tell the truth about our government, they call us treasonous and say we’re speaking out of line and they’d like to punish us, and I think that’s part of what’s happening with social media,” Paul told RT, adding that he hopes anti-government or anti-war voices can eliminate their “dependency” on the current social media platforms.\n“I’m just hoping that technology can stay ahead of it all and that we can have real alternatives to the dependency on Twitter and other companies that have been working hand in glove with the government,” Paul added.\n(source)\nHere’s a video from last month with Dr. Paul’s thoughts about the social media purge.\nIn it, he reminds us that Facebook is a private entity so they do have every right to remove the pages they wish.\nThe danger – and the area in which this treads on the First Amendment – is their direct ties to the government.\nThis affects everyone.\nIf you’re reading this and you shrug because you, personally, don’t have a Twitter or Facebook account, you’re missing the bigger point.\nConsider the fact that the “population” of Facebook is bigger than the populations of the US, China, and Brazil combined.\nThat’s how many people will now only receive one side of the story on things like war, politics, guns, and current events.\nPeople will believe what they’re told because there is no alternative information presented.\nThere are no questions asked.\nIt’s literally the textbook definition of brainwashing.\nDefinition of brainwashing\n1: a forcible indoctrination to induce someone to give up basic political, social, or religious beliefs and attitudes and to accept contrasting regimented ideas 2: persuasion by propaganda or salesmanship (source)\n(Here’s an article from Psychology Today that discusses how Facebook is, in fact, brainwashing people for profit.)\nSocial media is a massive source of information and influence today.\nIf the information is rigged by entities that support socialism, gun control, and the end of privacy, we’re doomed.\n2.2 billion active users will be bombarded with these messages without any real option for the other side of the story.\nSo regardless of whether you, personally, participate, this will color popular sentiment to a massive degree.\nIt will grow the cognitive dissonance that assures people of things like “the government is your friend” and that “you don’t need to protect yourself, the police will take care of you.”\nPeople who hate freedom will get unfettered access to the minds of 2 billion people.\nThat should scare the crap out of you.\nWhat can you do about the alternative media purge?\nIt’s possible but unlikely that social pressure on Facebook and Twitter will push the outlets into restoring the accounts of these alternative media networks.\nBut even if they are restored, I suspect their reach will dwindle even further.\nHere are a few things you can do:\nSubscribe to the newsletters of websites you enjoy.\nDon’t count on seeing their work on social media.\n(You can subscribe to my newsletter here, incidentally.)\nSupport them financially if you can.\nMany sites have Patreon accounts or donate buttons\nBookmark them and visit regularly – if they have ads, your visits help them to make the money they need to stay afloat.\nShare their articles on your own social media accounts.\nIf they can’t get their work out there, we can help.\nJoin alternative social media outlets like Gab and MeWe.\nThe truth is getting harder and harder to find.\nYou’re going to have to dig for it.\nWe’re watching the biggest campaign against freedom of speech and thought that has ever occurred in our part of the world.\nThe alternative media purge is just the beginning.\nAnd we should all be very concerned.\nArticle posted with permission from Daisy Luther\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":

it is clear that the missiles in question had been in the possession of Yemen well before the Saudi Arabian-led intervention of 2015, and that their source was either Soviet or North Korean.\nThe modification kits, on the other hand, appear to be of Iranian origin, and were transported to Yemen via Oman.\nThe UN panel claims not to have any evidence of ‘external missile specialists’ working alongside the Houthi; indeed, the simplicity of the Burkhan 2-H modification concept is such that anyone already familiar with the SCUD-B missile system would be able to implement the required processes without outside assistance.” [emphasis added]\nSo where did the missiles come from, and who made them?\nAccording to Ritter:\n“Rather than the Iranian-manufactured Qiam-1 missiles Haley and the Saudi Arabian government claimed, the debris presented by Haley were of a modified Soviet-manufactured SCUD-B missile; the airframe and engine are original Soviet-made components, and many of the smaller parts on display bear Cyrillic (i.e., Russian) markings.\nThe transformation to the Burkhan 2-H design required the Houthi engineers to increase the size of the fuel and oxidizer tanks, and lengthen the airframe accordingly.\nThis is done by cutting the airframe, and welding in place the appropriate segments (this also required that the fuel supply pipe, which passes through the oxidizer tank, be similarly lengthened.)\nThe difference in quality between the factory welds and the new welds is readily discernable.\nThe increased fuel supply permits a longer engine burn, which in turn increases the range of the missile.\nThe Burkhan 2-H uses a smaller warhead than the SCUD B; as such, the guidance and control section had been reconfigured to a smaller diameter, and an inter-stage section added to connect the warhead/guidance section with the main airframe.”\n﻿\nThose who have been paying attention to this conflict have been well aware that the U.S. has had little material evidence to link Yemen’s Houthis to Iranian arms suppliers.\nIn January of this year, a panel of U.N. experts stated:\n“The panel has not seen sufficient evidence to confirm any direct large-scale supply of arms from the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, although there are indicators that anti-tank guided weapons being supplied to the Houthi or Saleh forces are of Iranian manufacture.” [emphasis added]\nEven if Iran were arming the Houthis, Haley’s hypocritical anti-Iran rhetoric doesn’t excuse the U.S. for continuing a foreign policy that essentially armed ISIS through U.S. weapons transfers, or for arming al-Qaeda’s affiliate in Syria, just to name two examples of Washington’s schizophrenic approach to the region.\nWhy is the U.S. singling out Iran, especially when the Houthi rebels are sworn enemies of al-Qaeda?\nThe issues here go much deeper than nonsensical hypocrisy.\nAccording to Ritter, the entire debacle has shown that if Saudi Arabia cannot contain the Houthi’s missile capabilities, it cannot possibly hope to take on Iran, which possesses a significantly more advanced military than the Houthis do on their own.\nRitter explains further:\n“If a relatively unsophisticated foe such as the Houthi, using Iranian-modified Soviet and North Korean missiles derived from 40-year-old technology, can evade an enemy force using the most modern combat aircraft backed up by the most sophisticated intelligence gathering systems available, and successfully launch ballistic missiles that threaten the political and economic infrastructure of the targeted state, what does that say about the prospects of any U.S.-led coalition taking on the far more advanced mobile missile threats that exist in North Korea and Iran today?\nThe fact of the matter is that no military anywhere has shown the ability to successfully interdict in any meaningful way a determined opponent armed with mobile ballistic missile capability.\nIf the Saudi experience in Yemen is to teach us anything, it is that any military plan designed to confront nations such as North Korea, Iran and Russia that are armed with sophisticated mobile ballistic missiles had better count on those capabilities remaining intact throughout any anticipated period of hostility.\nNo amount of chest-thumping and empty rhetoric by American political and/or military leaders can offset this harsh reality.\nThis is the critical lesson of Yemen, and the United States would do well to heed it before it tries to foment a crisis based upon trumped-up charges.” [emphasis added]\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Doubt\t0\t32\nLoaded_Language\t5405\t5427\nLoaded_Language\t5170\t5182\nDoubt\t2154\t2260\nLoaded_Language\t1183\t1219\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice\t7086\t7235\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice\t904\t1003\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice\t355\t449\nLoaded_Language\t6962\t7085\nDoubt\t2380\t2444\nWhataboutism\t305\t337\nDoubt\t5443\t5543\n"}]}

Keith Ellison (D-MN), who is running for attorney general in Minnesota without an active attorney's license, has not stood before a committee to deny or address accusations against him by several women who have accused him of verbal and physical abuse.\nAt least one woman even filed a police report about his abuse.\nNo, Ellison has called on the House of Representatives, not the FBI, as Senate Democrats have urged in the case of Judge Kavanaugh, to investigate the claims.\n\"I am taking this step now because I am innocent and eager to see this entire matter resolved,” Ellison said in a statement.\n“These allegations have lingered in the public sphere, and remain unsubstantiated,\" he added.\n\"I welcome an investigation by the House to allow us to move on.\"\ntake our poll - story continues below\nWho should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?\nWho should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?\nWho should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?\n* John Bolton Richard Grenell Dina Powell Heather Nauert Ivanka Trump\nEmail *\nComments This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\nCompleting this poll grants you access to Freedom Outpost updates free of charge.\nYou may opt out at anytime.\nYou also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\nWell, that's not entirely accurate.\nWe do have a police report, unlike the accusations against Brett Kavanaugh.\nOf course, his supporters have hired an attorney to perform an investigation.\nThe Star Tribune reports:\nThe Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party has hired attorney Susan Ellingstad to conduct a separate investigation.\nEllingstad is a partner at the firm where attorney Charles Nauen, who represents the DFL, works.\nDFL Chairman Ken Martin said on Tuesday that the investigation was finished or close to finished and would be released soon.\nEllison is also deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee.\nAfter the domestic abuse allegation emerged in August, the DNC said it is looking into what happened.\n“All allegations of domestic abuse are disturbing and should be taken seriously.\nWe are working with the Minnesota state party to review these allegations,” a DNC spokeswoman said in a statement Wednesday morning, declining to comment further.\nThe Democratic Party’s choice of Ellingstad to conduct the investigation was met with derision from many who said she is not independent, including Donald Trump Jr., who mocked the investigation in a Tweet Wednesday.\nThe firm Ellingstad works for, Lockridge Grindal Nauen, has a political committee that has donated to both Republican and Democratic candidates, including Ellison, according to Federal Election Commission filings.\nThe contributions to Democrats outweigh the Republicans by a margin of about four to one.\nAs we previously reported:\nRep. Keith Ellison, who is currently running for attorney general of Minnesota, is being accused of domestic violence against his former partner Karen Monahan.\nAustin Monahan, Karen Monahan’s son, aired the allegations in a Facebook post Saturday night.\nAccording to Austin Monahan, Ellison put his mother through “pure hell.” In the Facebook post, he claims to have seen a video of Ellison dragging Karen Monahan off the bed by her feet while screaming expletives at her.\nThe alleged incident is just one of several, Austin Monahan warned.\nState Rep. Debra Hilstrom (D-Brooklyn Center) was quick to voice her concern over the accusations, calling on Ellison to “answer these allegations.” DFL-endorsed candidate for attorney general of Minnesota Matt Pelikan also reacted to the story, calling the allegations “extremely troubling.” Karen Monahan has also hinted at the alleged abuse on Twitter, telling Ellison that her “kids, job, health, finances, humanity was deeply impacted by the abuse you are well aware of.” Karen Monahan claims she has videos, recordings, and messages to prove her story.\nEllison has admitted the relationship, but is denying the abuse.\nAnd the relationship was clearly real.\nKaren Monahan, an organizer with the Sierra Club, was in a relationship with Ellison for years.\nThe two are seen together in many of her social media posts, including hiking in together national parks and posing with the Obamas at the White House.\nRecords show she lived in his Minneapolis home before their relationship ended.\nEllison, who was previously married to a different woman, is divorced.\nIt's hard to know what really happened in a relationship.\nAnd the media has kept it quiet.\n\"Keith Ellison flatly denies allegation that he abused an ex girlfriend.\nThe story had been circulating in MN, and not held up under media scrutiny, so no stories ran.\nIt blew up last night after the ex’s son posted the allegation on Facebook.\"\nDave Weigel.\nIt's not quite the first time for Keith X.\nThis is not the first time Ellison has faced misconduct allegations.\nIn 2006, a woman named Amy Alexandar claimed that Ellison ostracized her and smeared her name after having an extramarital affair with her in the 1990s and then again in the 2000s.\nEllison in 2005 filed a restraining order against her after what he described as phone and email harassment.\nShe subsequently tried to get a restraining order against him, which a judge denied, ordering her to stop repeating allegations of an affair or intimidation.\nEllison subsequently agreed to dismiss his restraining order against her if she no longer contacted him.\nI'm not sure that this is nothing more than damage control just before the elections.\nEllison won the primary days after the allegations were made public.\nOf course, accusations does not make one guilty for Ellison anymore than they do for Judge Kavanaugh.\nHowever, at least in the case of Ellison, at least one of the women were not scared about their reputation and had any political motive to call the police and file a report.\nWhen it comes to Ellison though, we know he is an effeminate pansy who simply does not want to answer to the American people and even seeks security to hide from a female report with a mic and a camera.\nJudge Kavanaugh has faced it all and fought back against it.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Name_Calling,Labeling\t6055\t6071\nFlag-Waving\t6114\t6129\nLoaded_Language\t3769\t3788\nLoaded_Language\t3272\t3281\n"}]}

(AP) - Federal prosecutors say the FBI has arrested five former residents of a ramshackle compound in New Mexico on firearms and conspiracy charges as local prosecutors dropped charges in the death of a 3-year-old boy at the property.\nTaos County District Attorney Donald Gallegos said Friday his office will now seek grand jury indictments involving the death.\nGallegos said seeking indictments will allow more time to gather evidence.\nAll five people will remain in custody pending a Tuesday hearing in federal court.\nThe U.S. Attorney's Office in Albuquerque said compound resident Jany Leveille has been charged with being an alien unlawfully in possession of firearms and ammunition.\nShe is a Haitian national.\nThe other four members are charged with conspiring with Leveille.\nAnd the death of the three-year-old?\nNothing!\nAnd what of the training of little jihadis?\nNothing!\n“The defendants, Jany Leveille, 35, a Haitian national illegally present in the United States, Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, 40, Hujrah Wahhaj, 37, Subhanah Wahhaj, 35, and Lucas Morton, 40, are charged in a criminal complaint that was filed earlier today in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico,” the bureau said in a statement.\n“The criminal complaint charges Jany Leveille with being an alien unlawfully in possession of firearms and ammunition in the District of New Mexico from Nov. 2017 through Aug. 2018,” the bureau said.\n“The criminal complaint charges the other four defendants with aiding and abetting Leveille in committing the offense, and with conspiring with Leveille to commit the offense.”\nYet, in the midst of all of this, don't forget that the FBI ignore the intelligence that was provided to them, just like they have in many cases, which, if they had acted, they may have saved the little boy's life.\nIn the meantime, the New Mexico district attorney who failed to file for a preliminary hearing within 10 days and didn’t show up for court is vowing to pursue prosecution of these jihadis.\n“The actions yesterday by the district judges do not affect our continuing efforts to prosecute the individuals as charged originally,” Eighth Judicial District Attorney Donald Gallegos said in a statement on Thursday.\n“While we disagree with the judges, they did their jobs.\nWe will continue to do ours.\n“Going forward, our options are to refile the charges or take the cases to the grand jury.\nWe are assessing and will decide which avenue to pursue.\nWhat is important to know is that we will continue to pursue prosecution of the cases.”\nStatementThe actions yesterday by the district judges do not affect our continuing efforts to prosecute the... Posted by Eighth Judicial District Attorney on Thursday, August 30, 2018\nHe also sought to fight back against criticism in his failure to perform his job.\n“Finally, I have always welcomed criticism and, as public servants, our judges should also,” Gallegos said in the statement.\n“However, I ask that you be civil and respectful in your criticisms as that is more constructive.\nCussing and threatening the people involved will not accomplish justice and serves no useful purpose.\nRemember, you do not have all the facts.\nThat will develop as the cases progress.\"\nYeah, well, that's about as trustworthy as the FBI in this matter.\nThis latest move, while welcome, may only be a response to President Donald Trump's vow to \"get involved.\"\nHowever, I ask, why were you not involved in the first place, Mr. President?\nAccording to the Constitution, you, and you alone, are the sole head of the executive branch, and as such you are where the buck stop in making sure the laws are faithfully executed.\nSo, if Trump is going to fire Sessions, perhaps he should stop talking about it and get to it and actually put someone in the Justice Department as attorney general who will do the job faithfully, and by that, I don't mean Trey Gowdy.\nI mean someone who is serious about justice, not political grandstanding or covering up criminal activity.\nUntil then, I'll consider this the means the FBI will use to engage in the further coverup of what really took place at that compound beyond the bulldozing of a crime scene, and possibly, their own complicity.\nArticle posted with permission from Sons Of Liberty Media\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Name_Calling,Labeling\t3167\t3174\nLoaded_Language\t4762\t4791\nDoubt\t1960\t1995\nDoubt\t453\t600\nName_Calling,Labeling\t2034\t2048\nLoaded_Language\t1997\t2004\nDoubt\t3004\t3126\nDoubt\t4865\t5165\nDoubt\t3951\t3981\nName_Calling,Labeling\t187\t218\nDoubt\t2806\t2985\nRepetition\t2050\t2057\nLoaded_Language\t4206\t4230\nName_Calling,Labeling\t165\t184\nName_Calling,Labeling\t27\t53\nDoubt\t2006\t2048\nLoaded_Language\t2050\t2057\nRepetition\t294\t300\nDoubt\t4403\t4456\nDoubt\t4565\t4823\n"}]}

weekend, the #FreeTommy Robinson rally drew upwards of 20,000 supporters, according to organizers, in support of the outspoken critic of Islam and exposer of their crimes in his country and against his tyrannical arrest and imprisonment.\nAmong those in attendance at the Saturday rally in London outside Downing Street were UKIP leader Gerard Batten, For Britain leader Anne Marie Waters, former Breitbart London editor-in-chief Raheem Kassam and Dutch opposition leader Geert Wilders.\nWilders, who had been banned from entering the UK, tweeted out his support of Tommy Robinson prior to

@BreitbartNews — Geert Wilders (@geertwilderspvv) June 9, 2018\nIn his speech, he encouraged those listening that they were not alone, and said the gathering of the people was meant to be a voice to the UK government to \"Free Tommy Robinson!\"\nBatten echoed that sentiment saying, “Tommy Robinson is a political prisoner.\"\n“Whatever the legal technicalities of his alleged contempt of court, he was imprisoned more for who he is and what he says rather than what he is supposed to have done.,\" he added.\n“It’s not necessary to agree with everything he says, it’s not necessary to approve of everything he does, but history will judge him as being on the right side of a struggle between good and evil,” Batten continued.\nHe then went on to blast the policies of the UK that are truly harming their own people, specifically “widespread, organized, paedophile rape of little girls by organized gangs” while those in authority “brush it under the carpet.”\n“Governments in this country and across Europe are now the enemies of their own people, [and] they promote policies that are against the interests of their own people,” he railed — citing efforts to sabotage Brexit, uncontrolled mass migration, and what he described as “Islamisation” in particular,\" he said.\n“A literalist interpretation of the Mohammedan cult is completely alien to everything our country stands for and our traditional way of life,\" Batten continued.\n“And yet instead of opposing Islamisation, our government is submitting and surrendering to it.\nThey have betrayed the British people.\"\n“Now, ‘Islam’ means ‘Submission’.\nYou either submit, or you resist.\nAre you going to submit?” he asked the crowds.\n“Are you going to resist?”\nThe crowd shouted back their support of resisting and not submitting to the Islamization of their culture.\nSharia Watch founder Anne Marie Waters also spoke at the rally.\n“Our leaders, our media, our police, all prioritize Islam in their decision-making,” she said.\n“Why is it so easy for our state to jail Tommy Robinson, when it is so difficult to jail a group of men found with an underage girl in a bedroom?\nWhy is it so much easier to jail Tommy Robinson?\n“Why is it so easy to jail a man for leaving bacon at a mosque, but so difficult to jail jihadis who preach murder and death to the British people?\"\nshe continued in a line of questioning.\n“Why is it so easy for judges to make rulings that allow known terrorists and jihadists to stay in our country?\nWhy is the British government allowing ISIS fighters to return from Syria and threaten our safety?\n“Why do we talk and investigate and get angry about an accidental fire in Grenfell, but are expected to immediately forget — or ‘not look back in anger’ — about the deliberate, ideology-driven murder of British children?\"\nWaters went on.\n“And why are Muslims allowed to cover their faces with a black sack while the rest of us are subject to strict security?\nWhy are children being mutilated and forcefully raped while the law looks the other way?\nForcefully married, child married, while the law looks the other way?\nWhy?\nWhy are animals slaughtered in agony and terror and Halal imposed on all of us in a country that has legislated against unstunned slaughter?\nWhy?\"\n“Why is it so easy, Theresa May, to jail Tommy Robinson, but so difficult to do anything at all about the monstrous crimes committed in the name of Islam all over this country every day?\nWhy?” Waters asked.\nWell, the questions are obviously rhetorical.\nWe know why.\nThe UK is frightened of the Islamists, and by being frightened into submission, they are being complicit in the crimes of the devout Muslims there.\nMy speech at the #FreeTommy protest yesterday.\nWe need answers to our questions, and we need an MP in Parliament who will ask them.\nhttps://t.co/Rxx13odSC8 — Anne Marie Waters (@AMDWaters) June 10, 2018\nKassam also spoke at the event, reminding supporters of what was happening all across Europe due the mass influx of Muslim migrants.\nThen he encouraged them with a piece of American history.\n“I’m sure we have some American friends in the crowd, on stage, and watching at home,” Kassam concluded.\n“You know there was a man called Paul Revere.\nHe rode through the night on his horse.\nHe said, ‘The British are coming, the British are coming!’ Well, let you tell you something; we’re here today to say a similar thing: The British are coming back!”\nI do hope that is true, but unless the Brits are going to put the same kind of fear in their representatives that the Muslims are doing, they can't expect to do what they want to do.\nWhat Britain needs is a return to the God of their forefathers, the One Oliver Cromwell served.\nThey need to fear Him more than they do the Islamic terrorists and rape gangs.\nThen, and only then, will they render justice for the Muslim criminals, rid their land of such public idolatry and protect the people like Tommy Robinson who rightly tell the truth.\nArticle posted with permission from Sons of Liberty Media\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":

Glenn Greenwald Best Price: $2.66 Buy New $11.34 (as of 02:05 EST - Details)\nMany believed what media and social media did during that election, and still now, and take on the opinion that people cannot just say what they want on the internet.\nThis has some validity, but ultimately, the fact that Facebook pages with credibility were deleted makes it quite clear what’s going on here.\nThese pages presented declassified documents, information about corporations and mainstream media, real whistleblower testimony and more.\nYet still, they were deleted.\nThe population should be able to examine a source of information and determine for themselves if it’s credible, not have an authority figure do it for them.\nWe don’t need fact checkers, we ourselves should be those fact checkers!\nWe have a responsibility to our planet to be those fact checkers, and not let authority figures with a tremendous amount of power, wealth, and conflicts of interests do it for us.\n“The problem of fake news isn’t solved by hoping for a referee, but rather because we as citizens, we as users of these services, help each other.\nWe talk and we share and we point out what is fake.\nWe point out what is true.\nThe answer to bad speech is not censorship, the answer to bad speech is more speech.\nWe have to exercise and spread the idea that critical thinking matters, now more than ever, given the fact that lies seem to be getting more popular.” –Edward Snowden (source)\nFacebook A Revolving Door\nFacebook has become a revolving door like Monsanto, with high-ranking DARPA employees, like Regina Duggan, who has since left Facebook, and people from similar backgrounds now spearheading their mission.\nWhat is Facebook’s mission?\nWell at the moment it seems to be censoring of information.\nTheir key strategy is to label everything as fake news to build an excuse to delete Facebook pages that are dissenting voices.\nYou see, independent media, like CE, became extremely popular, receiving many millions in website every single month, that traffic came from Facebook.\nIndependent media outlets were greatly surpassing mainstream media in their power and voice.\nThis is something people on the outside can’t really see as all of this happens, but I am on the inside, so I see exactly what’s taking place.\nEyes were shifting away from the small group of people who have controlled media since media’s inception.\nIndependent media brought to light a number of facts that threaten the agenda of the global elite, like intelligence agency/government connections to mainstream media for example, and their plans in the middle east to basically invade, take-over, and establish a government that suits the Deep State’s best interests.\nThere are several examples from all fields that surround human life, from healthcare to politics, and it all seems to be controlled by one massive conglomerate at the top.\nWe’ve been writing about this for nearly a decade now.\nThe Deep State Has Power Due To Our Unconsciousness\nThey (global elite) continue to do what they are able to do because of human consciousness.\nThe more people who consider this a “conspiracy theory” and turn their heads away, the easier it is for them to continue and have power.\nI don’t understand how so much information can come to light, yet when it’s deemed a “conspiracy” theory” within mainstream media, everybody simply follows the rhetoric, without doing any investigation or research for themselves.\nIf you don’t look into it, don’t share an opinion on it.\n“Condemnation without investigation is the height of ignorance.” – Einstein.\nAll of these media sources were operating normally until Donald Trump became president, and until Hillary Clinton, Obama, Bush, etc were outed as global elite puppets.\nHeck, the Clinton’s and John Podesta have even referenced Wikileaks before that became ‘fake.’ Despite operating with credibility for more than a decade before the accusations.\nWhat does the media operating normally mean?\nStill manipulating the public, but at least they were reporting on both sides as a whole.\nNow, it’s quite different.\nDonald Trump is extremely vilified not because he allegedly is/was racist/sexist, but because he threatens neoliberalism and neoconservatism, the American empire, one that continues to try and push an Orwellian state type of existence, which seems to be ramping up every single year.\nTrump was not supposed to win, and no this isn’t about democrats vs republicans or that Trump is a saviour.\nThe Deep State responded like they always do every time something ‘goes wrong,’ they blamed Russia, as well as media outlets like Collective Evolution and others.\nSome of which have now been deleted as mentioned above.\nTrump is Not The Solution, We Are\nThings are getting pretty ridiculous, but they’re too late.\nEven if they do succeed in deleting more independent media sites from social media, they cannot erase them from the internet.\nYes, social media platforms were great for spreading information across the internet and for having more people become aware of it.\nIt really showed what people were interested in, and what people wanted to see, but clearly, we do not live in a democracy and that doesn’t matter.\nAgainst the State: An ... Llewellyn H. Rockwell Jr. Best Price: $9.94 Buy New $9.95 (as of 01:45 EST - Details)\nPeople are still going to search for information, and alternative forms of information, given the fact that what they see coming from the mainstream is usually highly suspect and questionable.\nMore and more people see it this way because our consciousness continues to shift.\nSocial media platforms do not control the awakening but have been a great tool to grow it, but it’s something that cannot be stopped.\nThe more we awaken and truly see past the political games, the more we pull power from the power grid that keeps all this in place.\n2020\nNow, all of this seems to be taking place with perfect timing before the 2020 election.\nNo doubt that the Deep State will want to take back the presidency, but ultimately, we need to see the bigger picture here.\nWe need to see what politics actually is, and the past few years alone have provided us with the opportunity to see.\nIt’s nothing but elite people, corporations and the financial elite that have become drenched with so much power that they have been able to direct human will and use it for their own selfish purposes.\nWith powerful revelations that have come to light, like elite pedophilia and ritual abuse, and extreme corruption, why do we still participate?\nWhy do we choose to elect these people?\nWhy do we believe we live in a democracy when what people want to look at, and what the majority of people want to have done (like GMO-labelling), is completely censored?\nWhy are harmful ‘things’ surrounding us constantly when we have science showing it’s not safe, like cell phone towers etc.\nIt’s simply because power lies within the corporatocracy.\nDecisions aren’t being made with the best interest of humanity at heart, and this is why the system is failing because it’s not actually for the people.\nToday the path to total dictatorship in the U.S. can be laid by strictly legal means … We have a well-organized political-action group in this country, determined to destroy our Constitution and establish a one-party state … It operates secretly, silently, continuously to transform our Government … This ruthless power-seeking elite is a disease of our century… This group … is answerable neither to the President, the Congress, nor the courts.\nIt is practically irremovable.\n– Senator William Jenner (source)\nBefore 2020, they’re going to want to silence anything that creates awareness about the corruption, deceit and lies that have dominated the presidency and the entire military-industrial complex for years.\nThe fact of the matter is:\n“The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society.\nThose who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country.\nWe are governed, our minds are moulded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of.” – Edward Bernays (“the father of public relations”), Propaganda, 1928 (note that Bernays’ book, Propaganda, begins with the above quote).\nThis is what’s unravelling, and the stronger the push the unravel it, the stronger the reaction and response from the deep state.\nThe Takeaway\nRecognize what’s happening, the massive censorship of information, coupled with the ridicule or finger pointing, or even arrest of people who choose to voice an opinion in opposition to the rhetoric that’s constantly spewed by mainstream media, which in turn is usually believed by the masses.\nAt the same time, independent media represents a shift in consciousness.\nA shift in our perceptions, thoughts, feelings and general self-awareness about our own planet is changing, and thus, change has been sprouted in multiple different areas, including political corruption and the stranglehold it has over our world.\nWe are more aware, but there is still some ways to go…\nA good chunk of work has been done.\nA massive transformation of consciousness has taken place and it seems that a global mass is growing closer to a critical mass.\nThe censorship of independent media is irrelevant in a sense, because the shift will continue to happen, change will continue to happen, and information that the deep state does not want the public to

Trump Responds\n\nA Trump appointed federal judge has order the White House to restore CNN reporter Jim Acosta's press pass after the White House revoked it for his badgering of the White House press secretary, his handling of a White House aide and his continual questioning when he was allowed to ask a question and follow up.\nThe ruling has no basis in the Constitution, mind you.\nUSA Today reported on the ruling:\nWASHINGTON – A federal judge on Friday ordered the White House to restore CNN reporter Jim Acosta’s press badge, which had been revoked earlier this month after a contentious exchange at a news conference with President Donald Trump.\nU.S. District Court Judge Timothy Kelly, a Trump appointee, said the White House had violated Acosta’s Fifth Amendment right to due process by suspending his press badge without explanation or a chance for CNN to appeal the decision.\nKelly said White House officials couldn’t say who made the decision or how.\nThe judge ordered the government to restore the credential while the rest of the case – which drew a slew of support from other media outlets, including USA TODAY – is argued.\n“This court cannot restore Mr. Acosta’s access to press briefings that have already been held,” Kelly said.\nBut Kelly said he hasn’t considered at all yet whether the White House violated Acosta’s First Amendment rights.\nMore arguments are expected Tuesday.\n“I trust this litigation will continue at a rapid pace.” Kelly said.\nWhat?\nDue process?\nWait, Acosta was not charged with a crime.\nNeither his property, liberty nor his life was taken.\nThere is no due process here.\ntake our poll -

Church, by Steph Solis, USA Today, January 16, 2018]\nSaris should know that when the appeal of her decision that the Indonesian illegal aliens gets reviewed by the Supreme Court, her decision will be struck down.\nSo she seem to have acted to encourage the illegal aliens in the case she is managing to see the writing on the wall, and use her order prohibiting their arrest and deportation to flee the authorities.Even the illegal aliens know that minor kritarchs have no authority over deportations, especially those that have been fully adjudicated and any claim of asylum found to be without any basis so they are taking up other options to fight deportation, like fleeing and hiding.\nA federal judge on Wednesday signaled she may extend an order preventing the deportation of roughly 50 Indonesian Christians living illegally in New Hampshire, a process that immigration officials began after U.S. President Donald Trump took office.\nU.S. District Judge Patti Saris in Boston expressed concern the Indonesians could be deported before their administrative appeals were finished, given their claims they could face religious persecution in the world’s largest majority-Muslim nation.\n[U.S. Judge May Extend Freeze On Indonesian Immigrants' Deportation, by Nate Raymond, Reuters, January 17, 2018]\nFederal officials contend they have always had the authority to deport them at any time.\n“There’s no legal basis for them to ask for more time,” Vinita Andrapalliyal, a U.S. Justice Department lawyer, argued in court on Wednesday.\nFederal law gives authority over immigration matters to the executive branch, not the courts.\nOver the Justice Department’s objections, Saris last year ruled she had jurisdiction over the case.\nShe entered a temporary order blocking the Indonesians’ deportation until she could decide whether to impose a preliminary injunction.\nRonaldo Rauseo-Ricupero, a lawyer for the Indonesians, argued they should have 90 days to move to reopen their cases after receiving copies of their administrative case files and time to appeal any decision rejecting those motions.\n“We don’t want to put them on a ship back unless someone has had chance to look at if there’s a really bad situation for them,” Saris said.\n“That’s my concern.”\nAnd Kritarch Saris has not stopped.\nShe is moving forward with more orders to halt deportation of illegal aliens.Kritarch Saris just does not accept that the immigration courts found no basis for their claim of persecution, and there is no evidence that they would face persecution today.\nShe and other kritarchs have acted outside the law, something that the reporter surprisingly puts in the story.And the Treason Bar attorney demanded that Kritarch Saris create a whole new second immigration appeals system of unlimited delay for these illegal aliens.Kritarch Saris thinks that her feelings about a deportation are the same as the law.Well, that is not Kritarch Saris' concern.\nThe concern over persecution overseas is reviewed by the Executive Branch, and that decision was entered--there is no \"bad situation\" for her to be concerned about.\nAnd Saris is not the only kritarch that thinks they run immigration policy--Mark Goldsmith thinks he runs immigration policy as well.\nA federal judge in Michigan has ordered the government to give bond hearings in preparation for releasing hundreds of illegal immigrants from Iraq into the community, saying the Constitution protects them from indefinite detention in the U.S. U.S. District Judge Mark A Goldsmith, an Obama appointee, earlier had halted deportations for nearly 300 Iraqis, saying that although they had long been ordered removed, conditions on the ground in Iraq had changed and they deserved new hearings.\nHis latest ruling Tuesday evening goes further, certifying some of the Iraqis as a class-action lawsuit and saying most of them should be “allowed to return to their productive lives” while they wait for new hearings — meaning they must be released from detention unless the government can prove they are a major risk to public safety.\n[Judge Orders Potential Release Of Hundreds Of Illegals From Iraq, by Stephen Dinan, Washington Times, January 3, 2018]\nHe is ordering the release of hundreds of Iraqi illegal aliens and criminal aliens, all because he wants them to have another bite at the apple--they, like the Indonesians, lost claims to political asylum years ago.\nKritarch Mark Goldsmith\nBoth these kritarchs are part of illegal and unconstitutional #Resistance to the lawful immigration policies of President Trump.\nIllegal aliens get only one hearing and one set of appeals to deportation.\nThey don't get another new and illegal set of hearings and appeals just because some minor kritarch wants something.\nTime for Congress to end this by prohibiting review of immigration and deportation decisions.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":

apology\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton insisted in a weekend interview that he doesn't owe a personal apology to Monica Lewinsky, the former White House intern whose adult life has been defined by their inappropriate sexual affair and the global scrutiny that followed.\n'No,' he told NBC in an interview airing Monday on the 'Today' show.\n'I do not – I have never talked to her.\nBut I did say publicly on more than one occasion that I was sorry.'\n'I apologized to everybody in the world,' Clinton said, implying that was enough.\nAnd the flustered former president, more famous for his Don Juan-like seductions than for his policy legacy, portrayed himself, not Lewinsky, as history's victim in the mass-media's retelling of the 1990s saga.\nSCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS\nFormer President Bill Clinton said in an NBC interview airing Monday that he's never personally apologized to Monica Lewinsky for how their sexual affair turned her life upside down – and he doesn't owe her a mea-culpa\nThe former president carried on a lengthy affair with Lewinsky, often trysting with her just steps from the Oval Office\nWatch part one of @craigmelvin's interview with Bill Clinton and James Patterson pic.twitter.com/UC8KAQw8Ge — TODAY (@TODAYshow) June 4, 2018\nHer too: Lewinsky has emerged as an anti-bullying activist and now says Clinton engaged in a 'gross abuse of power' by seducing her\n'A lot of the facts have been omitted to make the story work,' he declared, 'I think partly because they're frustrated that they got all these serious allegations against the current occupant of the Oval Office and his voters don't seem to care.'\nAnd Clinton complained in the interview that he left the presidency financially ruined because of the costs associated with the legal consequences of his actions.\n'Nobody believes that I got out of that for free,' he said.\n'I left the White House $16 million in debt,'\nHe's worth about $80 million today, aided by an aggressive schedule of speaking events – many of which paid him six-figure fees for individual appearances.\nIn a March essay for Vanity Fair magazine, Lewinsky wrote that 'what transpired between Bill Clinton and myself was not sexual assault, although we now recognize that it constituted a gross abuse of power.'\nClinton is now on a book tour with co-author James Patterson but got pointed questions from NBC in an interview that aired Monday morning\nClinton, pictured denying his May-December affair when he was president, was already noted at the time for his lothario habits\nBut decades later, she's still traumatized by the aftermath of being identifed globally as the your woman the President of the United States kept on the side and used for his own pleasure just a few feet from the Oval Office.\n'I’m sorry to say I don’t have a definitive answer yet on the meaning of all of the events that led to the 1998 investigation,' Lewinsky wrote of the public humiliation that played out in seeming slow motion.\n'I am unpacking and reprocessing what happened to me.\nOver and over and over again.'\nClinton is launching a book tour to promote 'The President is Missing,' a fictional political thriller co-written with the famed author James Patterson.\nHe accused interviewed Craig Melvin of 'ignor[ing] gaping facts in describing this, and I bet you don't know you don't know them.'\n'This was litigated 20 years ago.\nTwo-thirds of the American people sided with me.'\nLewinsky is pictured on September 21, 1998 meeting with then-president Bill Clinton at a White House function\nIf he were president today, he said later, his most famous extramarital affair wouldn't 'be an issue, because people would be using the facts instead of the imagined facts.'\nPatterson, too, defended Clinton – by comparing his sexual affairs in office with those of two preceding Democratic presidents.\n'It's 20 years ago, come on!'\nhe blasted Melvin.\n'Let's talk about JFK.\nLet's talk about, you know, LBJ.\nStop already!'\nClinton piled on.\n'You think President Kennedy should have resigned?\nDo you believe President Johnson should have resigned?\nSomeone should ask you these questions because of the way you formulate the questions,' he jabbed.\n'I dealt with it 20 years ago, plus.'\nSuddenly philosophical and seeming to take a longer view of history, Clinton said: 'I have tried to do a good job since then with my life and with my work.\nThat's all I have to say to you.'\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":

in other words, don’t worry, folks, it’s all scientifically objective.\nThis research is being used to advise companies who host online platforms, such as Facebook, as well as governments, on how to stamp out online radicalization – using strategies such as working out ways of preventing people from seeing material posted that is deemed unsuitable in some way, or offering them alternative “nice” things to look at.\nThis is a seriously important issue.\nThe people and political powers behind such initiatives are manipulating behavior online and literally controlling how people think and get information.\nThey are the appointed guardians of the online hoi polloi.\nBut who guards the guardians?\nFor if Dr. Ganesh is in charge, we have some very worrying questions to ask.\nOne could start from the observation that the article is certainly not an academic piece, and gives no concrete evidence for any of the sweeping claims it makes about the so-called “alt-right” and the “manosphere”; nor does it, as any academic should do, attempt to test ideas and consider alternative explanations.\n(Oddly enough, this makes it rather like the groups it claims to criticize.)\nAnd the label of “violent extremist” turns out to be used very generously.\nGanesh makes wild leaps and inferences.\nHe talks of Darren Osborne, the perpetrator of the vehicular attack on Finsbury Park Mosque.\nThis was a heinous crime, and should rightly be condemned.\nBut why did Osborne do this, according to Ganesh?\nThe attack “was executed after he had become indignant after watching a BBC broadcast on child sexual exploitation and turned to social media to make sense of it.\nHe found a narrative from British counter-jihad groups closely aligned with the alt-right, such as Britain First and the founder of the English Defence League Tommy Robinson.” The British counter-jihad movement is thus swept into the same group of violent extremists as Osborne, because Ganesh “knows” they encouraged him.\nThe BBC broadcast was the drama based on real life, Three Girls, which showed real-life events of three of the (very many) victims of the Rochdale Muslim rape gangs.\nGanesh somehow knows precisely what went on in Osborne’s mind.\nRather than thinking that it was outrage at the behavior of the gangs of Muslim men of Pakistani background who abused the girls portrayed in Three Girls that caused Osborne to lose his mind and commit his terrible crime, Ganesh blames Obsorne’s act on the likes of Tommy Robinson.\nYet Robinson explicitly fights AGAINST political violence.\nWhat “narrative from British counter-jihad groups” can one find which suggests driving vehicles into innocent Muslims standing outside a mosque?\nI’m sure if there was any, Ganesh would, as a researcher at an elite institution, be able to find it.\nBut there is none offered – only surmise and Ganesh’s mindreading techniques.\nI suppose if you’re paid to fight online extremism, you’d better find it, or you’re out of a job and short of academic publication.\nWe have also the ridiculous idea that Tommy Robinson is “alt-right.” He, in fact, describes himself as a centrist – he’s said he agrees with Labour on some things, the Tories on other things, and he left the EDL precisely because he didn’t like the infiltration by the far right.\nHe shows no hint of racism or of white supremacism.\nThe writer of this shoddy article is working at one of the most elite universities in the world, on research funded by the European Union, and giving advice based on this sloppy thinking to those who are in charge of manipulating and policing the communications and information we have online.\nWe have to ask.\nIs it simply a coincidence that Tommy Robinson is now in prison, and that a “researcher” who presents such a misleading account of Robinson is currently actively engaged in consultation with Oxford University and the European Union in advising how to disrupt Robinson’s activities, reinforcing the lies and misrepresentations about him to those in power?\nThere’s more.\nBharath Ganesh’s profile tells us this: “During his Ph.D., Bharath was also a Senior Researcher at Tell MAMA, a national project dedicated to mapping and monitoring anti-Muslim hate in the United Kingdom.\nHe has given evidence in the Houses of Parliament on governance, extremism, gender, and hate crime and authored a number of reports in this area.”\nIs it simply a coincidence that this “researcher,” prior to coming to Oxford University, worked for Tell Mama, that factory for the production of bogus claims about Islamophobia?\nWho runs the Internet runs the world.\nIs this a partnership between Europe’s governments, the Internet giants, and Islamic influence?\nArticle posted with permission from Pamela Geller\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Repetition\t4137\t4155\nName_Calling,Labeling\t2184\t2202\nLoaded_Language\t352\t356\nLoaded_Language\t5256\t5266\nDoubt\t4184\t4189\nLoaded_Language\t958\t965\nLoaded_Language\t3497\t3501\nLoaded_Language\t197\t262\nDoubt\t5033\t5054\nLoaded_Language\t872\t879\nLoaded_Language\t5590\t5596\nRepetition\t1022\t1029\nRepetition\t3427\t3444\nLoaded_Language\t2094\t2114\nLoaded_Language\t394\t399\nRepetition\t6639\t6652\nDoubt\t4782\t4926\nDoubt\t2913\t2938\nDoubt\t123\t165\nRepetition\t2184\t2202\nLoaded_Language\t4647\t4655\nDoubt\t5957\t5969\nLoaded_Language\t3628\t3635\nLoaded_Language\t4754\t4761\nLoaded_Language\t5742\t5748\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice\t6829\t6913\nName_Calling,Labeling\t292\t302\nName_Calling,Labeling\t6748\t6760\nRepetition\t958\t965\n"}]}

Anderson and Special Agent in Charge James C. Langenberg of the FBI’s Albuquerque Division, said in a statement that the defendants’ home in Amalia, N.M., served as a firing range and training camp to carry out an attack as part of a religious prophecy.\nAccording to the indictment, some of the minors were being prepared “to engage in jihad and … to die as martyrs.”… Siraj Ibn Wahhaj’s lawyer in the state case, suggested that those charges were motivated by a degree of racial and religious prejudice against his Muslim client.\nIf the suspects were white Christians shooting guns on their property and practicing their religion, “No one would bat an eye,” Thomas Clark argued in court.\n“If these were white people of a Christian faith who owned guns, that’s not a big deal because there’s a Second Amendment right to own firearms in this country.\nIf these were white Christians, faith healing is of no consequence because we have freedom of religion in this country.\nBut they look different and they worship differently from the rest of us,” Clark said….\nLast month, two state judges were forced to dismiss child neglect charges against all five adults when the local district attorney’s office missed a 10-day deadline to present initial evidence of crime.\nA few days later, Taos-based District Attorney Donald Gallegos dropped charges related to the death of Siraj Wahhaj’s son, “saying he was seeking more time to assemble and analyze evidence, and that he intended to seek grand jury indictment,” The Durango Herald reported.\nArticle posted with permission from Robert Spencer\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Name_Calling,Labeling\t0\t36\nLoaded_Language\t2215\t2231\nLoaded_Language\t2621\t2684\nWhataboutism\t2850\t2975\nWhataboutism\t39\t93\nExaggeration,Minimisation\t184\t216\nLoaded_Language\t568\t584\nLoaded_Language\t665\t720\nLoaded_Language\t2028\t2056\nRepetition\t2215\t2294\nLoaded_Language\t1489\t1533\nWhataboutism\t3009\t3361\nExaggeration,Minimisation\t301\t336\n"}]}
