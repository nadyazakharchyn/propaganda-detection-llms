Obfuscation,Intentional_Vagueness,Confusion	 - Using deliberately unclear words, so that the audience may have its own interpretation, e.g. “It is a good idea to listen to victims of theft. Therefore, if the victims say to have the thief shot, then you should do it.”

 Records Support Claims That Minnesota Muslima State Rep Ilhan Omar Married Her Brother

Ilhan Omar has accused Israel of “evil doings” in Gaza and called Israel an “apartheid state.” It isn’t surprising that Ilhan Omar would think this way.
She is a hijab-wearing, devout Muslim, and Islamic Jew-hatred is in the Quran.
What is shameful about this is that her views are mainstream in the Democrat Party today.
She should never have been chosen as a candidate for Congress with hateful views of this kind, but this is the way the Democrat leadership, and the Democrat base, thinks.
They want candidates like Ilhan Omar.
And they know they’ll win, because this is their base today.

Neither the Democrat leadership nor the Democrat base cares that she married her brother.
She is a Muslim and a leftist, so she can further their identity politics.
That’s all that matters to them.
