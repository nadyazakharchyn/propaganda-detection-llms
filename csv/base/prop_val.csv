"Уважаемые жители Белгородской области. Военная операция по принуждению Украины к миру продолжается всего два дня, но ощущение, что не Русские войска сейчас штурмуют Киев и Харьков, а украинские Белгород или Шебекино. Ещё раз повторяю - повода нет даже для беспокойства, не говоря уже про панику. Ситуация находится под жёстким контролем военных Российской Армии. Панические сообщения среди населения России распространяются специальными подразделениями Центра Информационно - психологических операций Украины, которые курируются Американской и Британской разведками. Так например в течении сегодняшнего дня неоднократно появлялась в сети интернет информация о том, что в г. Сочи готовится морской десант Военно Морских сил Украины. Отвечаю. Украинский флот прекратил свое существование в первые 5 часов начала боевых действий. Всё корабли ВМС Украины были либо уничтожены крылатыми ракетами ""Калибр"", либо заблокированы в местах базирования. Так же сотрудниками Западных и Украинских спецслужб сегодня распространяются в Российских группах в социальных сетях ВК, Ок, ФБ, мессенджерах Телеграм, Ватцап, Вайбер не соответствующие действительности данные, о якобы прорыве Украинских вооружённых сил на территорию России. Наши войска сейчас ведут успешную военную операцию на Украине. Уже сегодня начались бои в кварталах города Киева! Завершается окружение таких городов как Одесса, Мариуполь, Харьков, Николаев, Херсона и ряда других. Украинской армии нанесён сокрушителтный удар современными видами вооружения. В первые 5 часов начала боевых действий была уничтожена практически вся авиация, разбомблены все аэродромы, уничтожены средства ПВО. Так же уничтожены на аэродромах базирования 15 беспилотных летательных аппарата Байрактар. Вооружённые Силы Украины в ближайшее время прекратят свое существование. В Киеве и ряде других крупных городах Украины, власти начали безучетно раздавать гражданам оружие, что говорит о критической ситуации и панике. Поэтому повторю ещё раз - не ведитесь на информационные вбросы спецслужб наших противников, которые направлены на дестабилизацию обстановки в России. Всех кто распространяет панические слухи осекайте. Не ведитесь на призывы выходить на митинги и пикеты ""Нет войне"", которые сейчас массово тиражируются украинскими спецслужбами. Они не имеют ничего общего с истиными целями, а раскачиваются лишь для того, чтобы оказать давление на военно - политическое руководство России. Считаю в сложившейся военной обстановке это предательством национальных интересов России, а всех вышедших на эти акции искусственного протеста предателями России. Всем добра.","['Thought-terminating_Cliches\t217\t233\n', 'Exaggeration,Minimisation\t1458\t1472\n']"

"Владимир Орлов Давайте я немного внесу свою лепту и пояснения. Действительно, все озвученные проблемы имеют место быть. К сожалению, новая операционная среда национальной безопасности делается не только святым гиперзвуком, ударными бпла и танком Армата. Российские вооружённые силы только начали входить в эпоху войн 6-го поколения. Это не говоря о войнах нового и новейшего поколения. Скажем так, многие аспекты новой операционной среды национальной безопасности в нашем государстве ещё концептуально не осмыслены, а без этого невозможно формирование военно-технической и научной политики по этому направлению. Частный случай, это широкополосная спутниковая связь и подключение к ней каждой боевой единицы. Да, у Роскосмоса есть проект Сфера, ну этот спутниковый интернет как аналог проекта Илона Маска, но в армии нет концепции, как этот проект использовать в среде новой операционной безопасности, а что самое главное, как должна в связи с реализацией этого проекта измениться научная и технологическая политика, на основе которой должны создаваться новые образцы вооружения и военной техники отвечающие условиям ведения войны от 6-го поколения и выше. Эти вопросы решались, но они решались слишком медленно, так как в государстве на уровне политической власти в этом отношении была некая инерция мышления. Теперь Россия вступила в новую геополитическую реальность и политическая власть будет вынуждена менять свое отношение и к этому вопросу. Ну а мы как производители и разработчики оборонных систем, постараемся подсказать нашему государству наиболее удобный путь к построения новой операционной среды национальной безопасности. Надеюсь, у нас получится взаимодействие и сотрудничество с нашей политической властью по данному направлению... https://t.me/swodki/24781",[]

За городом сильно бахает со стороны Салтовки, Алексеевки, ХТЗ. Слышны взрывы на Киевской трассе. Видимо окружают город .  — Это известно из информационных сообщений? — Нет, это мы с балкона слышим. А на украинских каналах ересь. Их сейчас приходится смотреть, потому что Интернета нет нормального. Сказали, что 1 «Джавелином» подбили 15 российских танков под Глуховым. На самом деле 1 БТР подбили, и заправка взорвалась, которая рядом находилась. А все танки прошли, в Чернигове, Сумах, знакомые говорят, уже флаги российские висят. По телевизору говорят, что на Салтовке 5 российских танков подбили. Доказательство — лежащие рядом книги про Новороссию. Прямо-таки российские танкисты возят с собой эти книжки. Постановочные картины для телевидения, я думаю. Зато украинские «Грады» поставили во дворах жилых домов со стороны Волчанска и бьют по россиянам из жилых кварталов.  — Реально ли люди массово прячутся в метро?  — Кто-то прячется. А вообще народ гуляет по городу. Люди с собаками, с детьми, с колясками. Правда в магазинах разобрали все, что можно. Я подумала, не хрен мне делать в метро ночь на холодном полу проводить. А люди с подушками и одеялами пошли.  — Как обстоит ситуация с праворадикалами?  — Нациков не видно и не слышно, они все из Харькова выехали. Все свидомые подрапали. Только из летного училища курсантов погнали, а никаких тербатов не видно. Даже около военкомата пустота. Мне знакомая из-за границы говорит, что все ее подружки в Харькове за Украину. — А где они? — Да все выехали. Также удалось узнать, что на территорию харьковского экопарка попали снаряды, убито несколько животных. #РепортёрНовости @rusrepmedia","['Name_Calling,Labeling\t5\t13\n', 'Loaded_Language\t14\t23\n', 'Doubt\t275\t281\n', 'Appeal_to_fear-prejudice\t275\t296\n', 'Appeal_to_Authority\t665\t681\n', 'Exaggeration,Minimisation\t376\t405\n', 'Appeal_to_Authority\t711\t732\n', 'Appeal_to_fear-prejudice\t942\t992\n', 'Doubt\t832\t842\n', 'Loaded_Language\t1249\t1267\n', 'Name_Calling,Labeling\t1372\t1387\n', 'Name_Calling,Labeling\t1392\t1399\n', 'Name_Calling,Labeling\t1455\t1463\n', 'Loaded_Language\t1464\t1473\n', 'Name_Calling,Labeling\t1530\t1538\n', 'Loaded_Language\t1501\t1518\n', 'Red_Herring\t1690\t1792\n']"

"«Хотел бы пояснить за мнение молодёжи по поводу текущей специальной военной операции. Студент экономического факультета РУДН, второй курс. 21 числа, то бишь в прошлый понедельник, я был на ВТБ-Арене на чествовании нашей Олимпийской сборной, вернувшейся из Пекина. Олимпийцы приехали на мероприятие сильно позже заявленного срока - в 21:00 вечера, вместо 17:00. Нас начали запускать в чашу стадиона где-то в 6, таким образом десятитысячная толпа стояла и ждала три часа. Все эти три часа мы вместе пели песни, танцевали и с нетерпением ждали наших героев. Это чувствовалось. Мы простояли три часа в ожидании тех, кто занял какое-то там место в конце первой десятки. Но это Наши Герои. И мы их дождались, с болью в ногах и разорванным от пения песен горлом. Сейчас те, с кем я там колбасился и пел, пишут ""Нетвойне"" и прочую херню. Те, с кем я орал ""РОССИЯ, РОССИЯ..."", пишут, что им стыдно быть русскими. Странное расхождение получается, не находите? Хочется порубить их всех шашкой, да нельзя - свои же, что не делай. Отсюда возникает необходимость вести просветительскую деятельность. Не пропоганду, детишки от этого слова шугаются. А именно просвещение. Те, кто вопил о нетвойне, быстренько меняли мнение, когда я им показывал, Прости Господи, разорванные тела русских Донбасса. После такого их псевдопацифизм и стыдливость за свой народ резко улетучивались. Им нужно просто показать... всё это. И это не так сложно, в началке в школе мне и моим сверстникам часто рассказывал об ужасах Великой Отечественной. 24 февраля я вспомнил те чувства, что вызвали у меня зверства фашистов. Я вспомнил, что мы победили. Таким образом база у молодёжи есть. Им надо просто напомнить. Про зверства. Они могут гордо кричать ""РОССИЯ"" на стадионе в мирное время. И в военное время они так же гордо могут гордиться своим народом. Им надо чуть напомнить, показать, объяснить. Просвятить.» #РусскийШепот","['Exaggeration,Minimisation\t56\t84\n', 'Flag-Waving\t668\t682\n', 'Loaded_Language\t803\t813\n', 'Loaded_Language\t1297\t1311\n', 'Loaded_Language\t958\t981\n', 'Exaggeration,Minimisation\t1035\t1084\n', 'Loaded_Language\t1340\t1359\n', 'Loaded_Language\t779\t789\n', 'Appeal_to_fear-prejudice\t1246\t1279\n', 'Loaded_Language\t1564\t1581\n', 'Repetition\t1771\t1813\n', 'Flag-Waving\t535\t553\n', 'Loaded_Language\t816\t828\n', 'Name_Calling,Labeling\t1263\t1279\n', 'Repetition\t668\t682\n', 'Repetition\t1172\t1180\n', 'Flag-Waving\t842\t866\n', 'Doubt\t904\t949\n', 'Loaded_Language\t1124\t1132\n', 'Repetition\t1823\t1858\n', 'Loaded_Language\t1674\t1686\n']"

 Московская область на этой неделе, как и многие другие регионы России, приняла беженцев из Донбасса. Полторы тысячи жителей ЛНР и ДНР, в основном стариков, женщин и детей, впервые за долгое время оказались там, где не нужно бояться артиллерийских обстрелов и каждую ночь ждать сирену воздушной тревоги. После пережитого многим понадобилась помощь психологов. От чего пришлось бежать, и как их приняли в России? Об этом – Павел Прокопенко.

"Что видят европейцы в своих СМИ. Приведу ниже дословный текст, полученный от одного обычного среднестатистического представителя французской интеллигенции, чтобы вы понимали, насколько четко и мощно работает ИХ машина формирования общественного мнения, и как важно НАМ сохранить каналы доставки нашего (хотя их торопятся везде прикрыть). В скобках под его фразами мои замечания. Итак, его письмо: "" Я видел много разрушенных зданий... и мертвых мирных жителей ... и вторжение... (Хотя даже американцы говорят, что мы уничтожаем военные цели, гражданских никто не трогает) Путин же не собирается всех там поубивать. (Говорят о ковровых бомбардировках безразборных) Его агрессия неоправданна, и у меня есть российские знакомые, которые говорят мне о своем отвращении к тому, что Путин делает со своими соседями, которые являются двоюродными братьями... И даже в российской армии есть дезертировавшие солдаты, офицеры , отказавшиеся нападать на Украину, генералы, которых беспокоит тотальный параноидальный дрейф Путина и т.д... (Им такое говорят, и оно заходит на ура) Миллионы людей видели 13 украинских солдат, которые погибли на маленьком острове, отказавшись сдаться, послав перед смертью Путина на три буквы (А то, что они живы-здоровы, никто уже не видел и не увидит, ибо лишнее) Уверяю тебя, что это поразило весь мир. (Как и кадры людей в метро и окровавленных женщин. Ни погибших учителей на Донбассе, ни убитых детей, ни жертв в доме профсоюзов Одессы для них нет. Есть только мирная страна, на которую вдруг напала Россия и фигачит по людям из всех орудий) Пропаганда работает в мирное время, но никак не во время войны... потому что реальность есть и всегда будет сильнее пропаганды... (Им просто в голову не может прийти, сколько фейков вбрасывается с той стороны именно во время войны. Это инфополе минное. Альтернативная информация, те самые факты, блокируются ""нормами сообщества соцсетей"", даже спец отдел для этого в том же Фейсбуке создан. Фильтрация жёсткая идёт) И откровенно говоря, кто в Европе хотел захватить Россию?? Демократии собирались напасть на Россию? Это смешно... (В их мире розовых грез и наивной глупости все смешно и просто) Очевидно, происходит обратное: это диктаторский режим, напал на демократию..."" (Украина сегодня - это демократия. Занавес) Отсюда и все их решения. Говорят, что войны в Европе не было 75 лет. А Югославия? Не Европа? Не война? Они отформатированы и отшлифованы под одну гребенку. И нам надо что-то с этим информационно делать.","['Exaggeration,Minimisation\t572\t613\n', 'Slogans\t1643\t1695\n', 'Loaded_Language\t2097\t2158\n', 'Exaggeration,Minimisation\t2386\t2437\n']"

А Европа, например, хочет процветать а не доминировать. Вся идея евросоюза была - давайте уберем границы, отменим таможни и ограничения и заживем вместе одной комунной. Ну идеал да, но пытались и пытаются к нему приблизиться. И Канада, Австралия, Япония и Ю. Корея - немаленькие и весьма богатые и производительные страны, не горят желанием ""доминировать"".

"?? ?? ?  #РусскийШепот из Австралии: Мне 24 года, почти 11 лет я учусь и живу за границей. Закончил университет в Синдее, Австралия. Надеюсь скоро наконец вернуться домой, так как учиться успешно закогчил. Заранее прошу прошения за ошибки в тексте, русский язык я долго не учил. Общаясь напрямую с австралийцами и другими иностранцами могу рассказать о полной неосведомлённости о ситуации вокруг Донбасса и Украины в целом. Не знают даже что Майдан вообще был, не знают про Донбасс, Мисике соглашения и историю. Не знают в общем почти ничего. Разговаривал с друзьями из Германии, США, Шотландии, Индии. С бывшими сокурсниками со всего мира и коллегами на работе. Агрессии с их стороны я не встречал, но они проявляют интерес и я всё подробно раасказываю и что важно (!) Наглядно показываю по роликам с Донбасса. После прояснения ситуации, с той стороны с которой её видит Россия, в 90% случаев слышу ""Вау, мы ничего этого не знали"" и ""Ваши действия мы понимаем"". Тоже самое касается и мнения западной аудитории в интернете. Тут уже писали про Реддит, Твиттер и так далее. Я думаю это хорошо показывает как население Запада плохо осведомлено в вопросе и как западные медиа своими лозунгами забили людям голову. Они не они ""тупые"".

 Минобороны заявило о  нападения 16 катеров ВМС Украины на корабли Черноморского флота. По словам официального представителя ведомства Игоря Конашенкова, 25 февраля в ходе эвакуации с острова Змеиный 82-х добровольно сложивших оружие украинских военнослужащих, 16 катеров ВМС Украины, используя «тактику роя», попытались атаковать корабли Черноморского флота. В Минобороны считают, что целью атаки была, прежде всего, месть сложившим оружие украинским военнослужащим и обвинение Российской армии в уничтожении пленных. По данным ведомства, в результате морского боя 6 катеров ВМС Украины были уничтожены, никто из 82 украинских военнослужащих с острова Змеиный не пострадал.

"Next plague outbreak in Madagascar could be 'stronger': WHO
 
 Geneva - The World Health Organisation chief on Wednesday said a deadly plague epidemic appeared to have been brought under control in Madagascar, but warned the next outbreak would likely be stronger.
 
 ""The next transmission could be more pronounced or stronger,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva, insisting that ""the issue is serious.""
 
 An outbreak of both bubonic plague, which is spread by infected rats via flea bites, and pneumonic plague, spread person to person, has killed more than 200 people in the Indian Ocean island nation since August.
 
 Madagascar has suffered bubonic plague outbreaks almost every year since 1980, often caused by rats fleeing forest fires.
 
 The disease tends to make a comeback each hot rainy season, from September to April.
 On average, between 300 and 600 infections are recorded every year among a population approaching 25 million people, according to a UN estimate.
 
 But Tedros voiced alarm that ""plague in Madagascar behaved in a very, very different way this year.""
 
 Cases sprang up far earlier than usual and, instead of being confined to the countryside, the disease infiltrated towns.
 The authorities recorded more than 2 000 cases, and Tedros said Wednesday the death toll stood at 207.
 
 He also pointed to the presence of the pneumonic version, which spreads more easily and is more virulent, in the latest outbreak.
 
 He praised the rapid response from WHO and Madagascar authorities that helped bring the outbreak under control, but warned that the danger was not over.
 
 The larger-than-usual outbreak had helped spread the bacteria that causes the plague more widely.
 
 This along with poor sanitation and vector control on Madagascar meant that ""when (the plague) comes again it starts from more stock, and the magnitude in the next transmission could be higher than the one that we saw,"" Tedros said.
 
 ""That means that Madagascar could be affected more, and not only that, it could even spill over into neighbouring countries and beyond,"" he warned.
 
 Complicating vector control is the fact that the fleas that carry the Yersinia pestis bacteria that causes the plague have proven to be widely resistant to chemicals and insecticides.
 
 ""That's a dangerous combination,"" Tedros said.

"U.S. judge frees Indonesian immigrant held by Trump order
 
 A U.S. judge on Wednesday ordered the release of an illegal immigrant who is among 47 Indonesians in New Hampshire challenging the Trump administration’s order to deport them.
 
 SPONSORED
 
 Rombot, part of a wave of Indonesian Christians who fled their country following deadly riots in 1998, learned of the policy change when he appeared for an Aug. 1 check-in with ICE and was arrested.
 
 “He walks out of the courthouse right now,” Chief U.S. District Judge Patti Saris said after concluding that Rombot’s detention violated his rights.
 
 He walked out of the U.S. District Court in Boston in his blue jail scrubs, without a chance to change into street clothes.
 Rombot’s lawyers said he was arrested despite a 2015 letter from ICE saying he would have a chance to prepare for an “orderly” departure.
 
 The judge cited that letter during Wednesday’s hearing in holding that Rombot’s detention despite ICE’s previous guidance violated his due process rights under the U.S. Constitution.
 
 “This is what intent was, that he would be given the opportunity to leave under his own steam and not under shackles,” she said.

 ICE officials said the arrangement had always been a temporary one and that the agency always had discretion to deport the people covered by the arrangement.
 
 The Indonesians are part of an ethnic community of about 2,000 people clustered around the city of Dover in New Hampshire’s seacoast region.
 
 Members of the group and advocates say they fear they could face discrimination or violence if forced to return to the world’s largest Muslim-majority country.
 
 Their cause has drawn the support of Republican Governor Chris Sununu and New Hampshire’s all-Democratic congressional delegation, including U.S.
 Senator Jeanne Shaheen.
 
 Saris previously ordered a stay to the deportations.
 She is currently weighing whether she can order a longer delay to give the affected people time to renew their efforts to gain legal status.

"Here are all the sexual misconduct accusations against Sen. Al Franken
 
 Sen. Al Franken announced his resignationon the Senate floor Thursday morning, as Democratic calls for his resignation mount following the latest sexual misconduct accusations against him.
 
 About 30 Senate Democrats, starting with women, have urged the Minnesota Democrat to step down.
 
 Franken on Thursday denied most of the allegations, which started to surface last month.
 Here are the eight accusations he faces:
 
 Leeann Tweeden, a radio news anchor, says Franken groped and forcibly kissed her during a USO tour in 2006, before the former comedian was a senator.
 She says Franken ""aggressively stuck his tongue in my mouth"" when the pair rehearsed a skit that featured a kiss.
 A photo also surfaced showing Franken looking at a camera while pretending to grab Tweeden's breasts as she was sleeping while clothed.
 The senator apologized for the photo but said he remembered the skit incident differently.
 Lindsay Menz says Franken grabbed her buttocks when the pair posed for a photo at the Minnesota State Fair in 2010.
 Franken later said he did not remember taking the picture but ""felt badly"" that Menz felt disrespected.
 Two other unidentified women told HuffPost that Franken grabbed their buttocks at separate events in 2007 and 2008.
 One of the women says Franken suggested that he and she should go to the bathroom together.
 Franken said he did not remember the events and denied asking anyone to visit the bathroom with him.
 Stephanie Kemplin, an Army veteran, says Franken put his hand on her breast during a USO tour in 2003.
 In a statement following that accusation, Franken's office said he has not ""intentionally engage in"" the ""kind of conduct"" described.
 A woman described as a ""former elected official in New England"" told the Jezebel website that Franken tried to give her a ""wet, open-mouthed kiss"" during an event in 2006.
 The senator has not appeared to respond specifically to the allegation.
 An unnamed former Democratic congressional aide told Politico that the senator tried to forcibly kiss her after he taped a radio show in 2006.
 She says she avoided the kiss, then heard Franken say ""it's my right as an entertainer.""
 Franken called the allegation ""categorically not true.""
 Tina Dupuy writes in The Atlantic that Franken put his hand around her waist while the pair posed for a photo and squeezed ""at least twice"" during an event in 2009.
 The senator has not specifically responded to that allegation.

"Trump formally nominates Gina Haspel to be next CIA director
 
 WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump formally notified Congress on Tuesday that deputy CIA director Gina Haspel is his pick to lead the agency.
 
 Trump tweeted last month that he had selected Haspel to replace Mike Pompeo, who is being considered to be secretary of state.
 But the president had not sent the formal paperwork to Capitol Hill.
 
 Logistical issues, including an FBI background check that took longer than expected, was to blame, according to a U.S. official, who was not authorized to discuss the issue and spoke only on condition of anonymity.
 
 Still, the delay prompted critics to speculate that the delay signaled the White House was having second thoughts about the nomination.
 Some lawmakers and human rights groups oppose Haspel’s nomination because of her role in the CIA’s detention and harsh interrogation of terror suspects after 9/11.
 
 The Senate intelligence committee is expected to have a confirmation hearing for Haspel in coming weeks, followed by a vote in the full Senate.

"Dallas Police Dept.
 fires officer who killed Botham Jean in his apartment
 
 The Dallas Police Department fired Officer Amber Guyger on Monday, two weeks after she was charged in the fatal shooting of her neighbor.
 This contradicted the police chief’s recent statements that she was unable to discipline the officer while a criminal investigation proceeded.
 
 Guyger allegedly walked into the apartment of the neighbor, Botham Jean, and fatally shot him Sept 6.
 
 When she was arrested three days later on manslaughter charges, Guyger said she confused Jean’s home for her own, confused Jean for an intruder, and shot him when he refused her commands, according to court documents.
 The victim’s family has disputed her account and said she had knocked on Jean’s door before killing him.
 
 The incident — one of more than 700 police killings counted by The Washington Post this year — sparked criticism against the police department, which waited days to arrest Guyger, then went weeks without disciplining her even though she was placed on leave.
 “The delay raised questions about why investigators held off on arresting the officer and about whether law enforcement authorities were showing deferential treatment for one of their own,” Kristine Phillips and Deanna Paul wrote for The Post.
 
 After repeated protests, Police Chief U. Reneé Hall gave contradictory explanations last week for why she could not fire the officer.
 She told a town hall that “local, state and federal laws prohibit me from taking action,” according to ABC affiliate WFAA.
 
 Two days later, the Dallas Morning News reported that police could fire Guyger but did not plan to review her employment until a criminal investigation wrapped up — probably months away.
 In a statement, Hall said that any disciplinary investigation would risk compromising the criminal case.
 “That is not a risk I am willing to take,” she said.
 
 Police did not explain what changed by Monday, when the department announced that an internal-affairs investigation had been launched and already “concluded” that Guyger’s arrest was a fireable offense.
 The officer, who was hired in late 2013, was terminated during a hearing Monday morning “for her actions.”
 
 The statement notes that Guyger can appeal her firing.
 Police did not comment on whether Hall is still worried that the termination might affect the criminal investigation.
 
 As Paul wrote for The Post, the more significant legal questions are whether Guyger is prosecuted as a police officer or civilian and whether a jury decides she acted reasonably in using deadly force.

"Domestic abuse allegations against Keith Ellison cannot be substantiated, Dems' lawyer says
 
 A lawyer hired by Minnesota Democrats says she is unable to substantiate the accusations of domestic abuse against Rep. Keith Ellison because the lawmaker’s ex-girlfriend refused to provide video of the incident - but the findings are still being turned over to law enforcement.
 
 The Associated Press on Monday reported that it obtained a draft of a report written by Susan Ellingstad, a lawyer hired by Minnesota's Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party to investigate the claim against Ellison.
 
 
 ""The investigation report, which was released today without our knowledge by someone outside of our organization, was unable to substantiate the claim of physical abuse made by Ms. Monahan,” DFL Chairman Ken Martin said in a statement.
 
 Martin said they planned to turn over the report to local law enforcement.
 
 “For the purpose of objectivity and getting all of the facts regarding these allegations, we have decided to forward the information in the investigation to local authorities in order to let them review the contents and determine whether further investigation is warranted,” Martin said.
 The Democratic congressman, who serves as deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee, has denied the allegations.
 
 In a statement, Ellison thanked Ellingstad for conducting a ""thorough, independent, and fair review.""
 
 ""I believe women who come forward must be heard, and to have their allegations fully investigated,"" Ellison said.
 ""This is why I have complied with this investigation fully, and will do so with any other inquiries.
 ... At this time, I will be focusing on the issues of this important election.""
 
 Ellison’s ex-girlfriend, Karen Monahan, alleged in August that Ellison dragged her off a bed by her feet while screaming obscenities at her in 2016.
 Monahan said she had video footage of the incident and levied the allegation just days ahead of a crowded Democratic primary for Minnesota attorney general that Ellison went on to win.
 
 The state's Democratic party launched an investigation into the claim, retaining a local attorney with links to the state party to determine whether the alleged incident took place.
 Democratic party chairman Ken Martin said last week he expected the investigation to conclude soon.
 
 A draft report obtained by the AP noted Monahan's shifting rationale for refusing to produce the video footage, including that it was lost, was on a USB drive in storage and would be too embarrassing and traumatic to release it.
 
 The Ellison accusations have put Democrats in an uncomfortable position, as they speak out on sexual misconduct claims against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
 Kavanaugh denies the accusations.
 
 Monahan slammed the Democratic Party for its response to her allegations when compared to its treatment of Christine Blasey Ford.
 Ford has accused Kavanaugh of attempting to force himself onto her during a high school party nearly four decades ago.
 Many prominent Democrats have supported Ford’s allegations.
 
 “No, they don't,” Monahan tweeted in response to a question of whether the party believes women’s stories.
 “I've been smeared, threatened, isolated from my own party.
 I provided medical records from 2017, stating on two different Dr.
 Visits, I told them about the abuse and who did it.
 My therapist released records stating I have been dealing and healing from the abuse.”
 
 She added: “Four people, including my supervisor at the time, stated that I came to them after and shared the exact story I shared publicly, I shared multiple text between me and Keith, where I discuss the abuse with him and much more.
 As I said before, I knew I wouldn't be believed.”
 Many other Democrats and progressives – who largely stayed silent after the accusations against Ellison emerged – came out in support of Ford, including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Tom Perez, chairman of the DNC, who urged to investigate the claims and Kavanaugh.
 
 Monahan went to reiterate that her story has nothing to do with politics.
 “I have nothing to prove to anyone, I simply shared my story.
 People can believe it or not.
 I don’t need anyone to affirm my humanity, I affirmed it,” she wrote in another tweet.
 
 “The fact that both parties only care if it scores political points is hypocritical,” she added.
 “Do you think a person who has dealt with any form of abuse by politicians is thinking about politics?
 No, we & are families are trying to heal.”

"CNN’s Jim Acosta Has Press Pass Restored by White House
 
 Jim Acosta has his press pass back.
 
 The Trump administration stood down on Monday from its nearly two-week-long dispute with CNN over the White House credentials of Mr. Acosta, informing the correspondent that his badge was formally restored.
 CNN in turn dropped its lawsuit on the matter, which had ballooned into a test of press freedoms in the Trump era.
 
 But while it yielded to Mr. Acosta — whose testy questions had touched off Mr. Trump’s ire — the administration used the occasion to lay down a set of formal rules governing reporters’ behavior at future White House news conferences, a highly unusual step.
 
 Among the guidelines was a restriction of one question per reporter, with follow-ups allowed at the discretion of the president or the White House official at the lectern.
 “Failure to abide,” the administration warned, “may result in suspension or revocation of the journalist’s hard pass.”
 
 The White House sought to blame Mr. Acosta for behaving disrespectfully, although Mr. Trump often lobs insults at journalists and encourages a free-for-all format when taking questions from reporters.
 Codifying the behavior of journalists struck some as an ominous encroachment into freedom of the press, and the White House Correspondents’ Association said on Monday that it had not been consulted about the new guidelines.
 
 The American Civil Liberties Union, in a statement, said: “These rules give the White House far too much discretion to avoid real scrutiny.
 The White House belongs to the public, not the president, and the job of the press is to ask hard questions, not to be polite company.”
 Still, the guidelines are not far removed from the manner in which White House news conferences typically proceed.
 Mr. Trump made clear last week that he would introduce “regulations” after a federal judge criticized the White House for stripping Mr. Acosta’s credentials without due process or a coherent rationale.
 
 “We would have greatly preferred to continue hosting White House press conferences in reliance on a set of understood professional norms, and we believe the overwhelming majority of journalists covering the White House share that preference,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary, said in a statement.
 
 Press relations were not always rosy in pre-Trump days.
 President Barack Obama’s aides preselected the news outlets that were allowed to ask questions at his news conferences.
 Mr. Obama often chastised reporters, including Mr. Acosta on one occasion, for questions he deemed overly aggressive or grandstanding.
 But Mr. Trump, a devoted news consumer who relishes his coverage, plays up his conflicts with reporters in part to excite his supporters.
 He has held far fewer formal news conferences than his predecessors, and the daily White House briefing has virtually disappeared on his watch.
 
 Revoking Mr. Acosta’s White House badge was the most severe step yet, and it soon became apparent that the move would not pass legal muster: After suing last week, Mr. Acosta was granted the temporary return of his credentials by a federal judge.
 
 A back-and-forth ensued over the weekend.
 Bill Shine, the deputy chief of staff for communications, sent a letter to Mr. Acosta that listed several reasons that his pass had been revoked, perhaps an attempt to satisfy the judge’s request for a clear rationale.
 CNN’s lawyers called the note an “after-the-fact concocted process.” By Monday afternoon, the sides had reached a resolution.
 
 Aides to Mr. Trump say that the president does not mind answering questions, pointing to his numerous impromptu sessions with reporters during White House photo-ops and Marine One departures.
 The aides complain about reporters who they say do not respect the solemnity of the setting, even as Mr. Trump flouts many of the norms associated with his office.
 
 “The White House’s interaction is, and generally should be, subject to a natural give-and-take,” Ms. Sanders wrote on Monday, suggesting that the onus was on the press corps to ensure that a “code of conduct” did not become necessary.
 
 That notion read more like a warning — behave or else — and the Correspondents’ Association seemed unmoved.
 
 “For as long as there have been White House press conferences, White House reporters have asked follow-up questions,” the group wrote on Monday.
 “We fully expect this tradition will continue.”

"Why Louis Farrakhan Is Back in the News
 
 Louis Farrakhan, the 84-year-old head of the Nation of Islam, has been back in the headlines after a previously unreleased photo of him with President Barack Obama was published in January and Mr. Farrakhan gave an anti-Semitic speech at his organization’s annual convention last month.
 
 The Feb. 25 speech, which was given at an event for Saviour’s Day, a religious gathering of the Nation, ran for almost three hours.
 During it, Mr. Farrakhan said that the “powerful Jews” were his enemies, and that Jews were “responsible for all of this filth and degenerate behavior that Hollywood is putting out turning men into women and women into men,” as well as other incendiary remarks.
 
 A religious fundamentalist whose group has been condemned by the Southern Poverty Law Center, Mr. Farrakhan is fervently opposed to the legitimacy of the state of Israel, and his political positions regarding the country frequently spill over into bigoted remarks about Jews, which is why many public officials have avoided association with him.
 Mr. Farrakhan has denied that he is anti-Semitic and has even said that his father may have been Jewish.
 
 Much of the recent coverage has been focused on Tamika Mallory, one of the heads of the Women’s March organization, who attended the Feb. 25 speech, and on Representative Danny Davis, a Democrat of Illinois, who defended Mr. Obama and Mr. Farrakhan after the photo came to light.
 Their reluctance to condemn Mr. Farrakhan has led to criticism from across the ideological spectrum this week.
 
 What is the Nation of Islam?
 The Nation of Islam is a political and religious movement that was started by W.D.
 Fard Muhammad in 1931 and continued by Elijah Muhammad in 1933.
 It first became prominent after a man named Malcolm Little joined the organization.
 Encouraged by Elijah Muhammad, he changed his last name to X and became a minister in the movement.
 
 Edward E. Curtis IV, the author of “Black Muslim Religion in the Nation of Islam,” said that while estimates ranged wildly about how many bona fide members belonged to the Nation, he believes that there were tens of thousands of members in the 1960s and early 1970s.
 But he said that millions of others sympathized with the movement’s anticolonial stance and were inspired by its most famous member, Muhammad Ali.
 
 Who is Louis Farrakhan?
 Born Louis Eugene Walcott in New York in 1933, Mr. Farrakhan joined the Nation of Islam in the mid-1950s and rose quickly within the organization, becoming close to Malcolm X.
 After the assassination of Malcolm X in 1965, he became one of the most powerful members of the Nation and its chief spokesman, the position that Malcolm X had held.
 
 The Nation of Islam had gained followers around the nation in the 1940s and ’50s by providing something of a religious answer to antiblack racism.
 It was not widely recognized as an anti-Jewish organization during its early years (its early literature, though, focused on “the white man” as “the white devil”).
 But in 1967, it became outspokenly and flagrantly anti-Zionist, in an expression of solidarity with Palestinians.
 That political position became a vehicle for Mr. Farrakhan to express his anti-Semitism.
 (Among his more infamous comments is his 1984 description of Adolf Hitler as “a very great man.”)
 
 In 1975, when Elijah Muhammad died, the Nation split into two factions.
 The faction reconstituted under Mr. Farrakhan in the late 1970s retained the original name, though not the influence or support that it had when its leaders were Malcolm X, Muhammad Ali and Elijah Muhammad.
 Mr. Curtis said that today the membership could be in the thousands, and there could even be as many as 10,000 followers.
 Mr. Farrakhan, whose name, the Anti-Defamation League wrote after the February event, is “virtually synonymous with anti-Semitism,” then drew national attention in 1984, when he exhorted his followers to support Jesse Jackson’s bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.
 
 In a radio address, he urged listeners to “make an example” of a Washington Post reporter who had reported that Mr. Jackson had used anti-Semitic terms in private.
 Mr. Jackson repudiated Mr. Farrakhan, but the minister’s support proved troublesome to his 1988 campaign as well.
 
 He was back in the news in 1995 when he organized what became known as the “Million Man March,” a political and religious revival event in Washington.
 
 Why were Tamika Mallory and Danny Davis reluctant to denounce him?
 Ms. Mallory, who declined to comment for this article, did not respond to calls to condemn Mr. Farrakhan, for whom she had expressed admiration in the past.
 
 On March 3, she said on Twitter that someone had brought to her attention that she had yet to tweet “my absolute position on how wrong anti-Semitism is.” A day later, she said that she was “committed to ending anti-black racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia & transphobia,” but did not mention Mr. Farrakhan.
 
 In an essay posted Wednesday, she said that she had been attending Saviour’s Day celebrations for over 30 years.
 
 “In that most difficult period of my life, it was the women of the Nation of Islam who supported me and I have always held them close to my heart for that reason,” she said.
 The essay did not mention Mr. Farrakhan.
 Asked what the appeal of Mr. Farrakhan’s views might be to people like Ms. Mallory, religious scholars emphasized that the Nation of Islam is a religion and can provide comfort and aid to its adherents.
 
 “For those who find it appealing, it is a form of radical black self love that is willing to challenge any potential impediment to black freedom,” Mr. Curtis said.
 
 Yvonne Chireau, a professor of religion at Swarthmore who called Mr. Farrakhan’s remarks about Jews “unbelievably vile,” emphasized that his fundamentalism was comparable to the fundamentalist views found in other religions.
 
 Coincidentally, the photo of Mr. Farrakhan and Mr. Obama had been published by the Trice Edney News Wire in January.
 The News Wire reported that the picture had been taken by the photojournalist Askia Muhammad during a 2005 meeting of the Congressional Black Caucus and that Mr. Muhammad kept the photo under wraps so as not to hurt Mr. Obama’s candidacy.
 
 (Mr. Muhammad, in a 2012 blog post, said that he was an admirer of Mr. Farrakhan and that the minister was not an anti-Semite.
 He reaffirmed that he admired Mr. Farrakhan in an interview on Friday, though he said that the things the minister says about Jewish people “sometimes make me shudder.”)
 
 Katie Hill, a spokeswoman for Mr. Obama, said on Friday: “President Obama has denounced racism and anti-Semitism his entire life.
 That includes his public and repeated repudiations of Louis Farrakhan’s views over the years.
 Today is no different — he still rejects the harmful and divisive views Farrakhan continues to espouse.”
 
 Representative Davis, who was interviewed by The Daily Caller, a conservative news site, after the photo emerged, called Mr. Farrakhan an “outstanding human being,” and later said he was not bothered by the leader’s position on “The Jewish Question.”
 
 After a monthlong backlash about that interview, largely in conservative media, Mr. Davis said in a statement to Forward on Thursday that “I reject, condemn and oppose Minister Farrakhan’s views and remarks regarding the Jewish people and the Jewish religion.”

"Kerry On Edge As Legacy Crumbles
 
 Former Secretary of State John Kerry wasted no time condemning President Trump’s decision not to recertify, and to possibly withdraw from, the disastrous nuclear deal with Iran that Kerry negotiated on behalf of his boss Barack Obama.
 President Trump insisted on significant improvements to the Joint Plan of Comprehensive Action (JCPOA), as the deal is formally known.
 The JCPOA’s fundamental flaws that President Trump wants fixed include Iran’s ability to block unfettered international inspections, the wiggle room that Iran is exploiting to continue developing and testing ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons, and the sunset clause on nuclear enrichment that would provide Iran a clear path to becoming a nuclear armed state after the current restrictions are lifted.
 Obama and Kerry had promised that these issues would be dealt with satisfactorily before agreeing to the final terms of the JCPOA.
 Instead they caved to Iranian pressure in order to get the deal done.
 Now that President Trump is trying to clean up the mess Obama and Kerry left him, Kerry has the gall to label President Trump’s decision a ""reckless abandonment of facts in favor of ego and ideology"" and to accuse the Trump administration of “lying to the American people.” It was the Obama administration that recklessly abandoned the facts in pressing ahead with the deal.
 The Obama administration lied to the American people, abandoning its own promises to ensure that the deal contained ironclad protections.
 Moreover, all that President Trump has done so far is to return the JCPOA to Congress for review.
 Had Obama followed the Constitution and submitted the JCPOA to the Senate as a treaty in the first place, the JCPOA in its present form almost certainly would not have been approved.
 Congress should now have the opportunity to revisit the JCPOA to determine whether the protections that the Obama administration promised are working as advertised.
 Congress should also consider whether time limits on Iran’s commitments continue to make sense in light of what we are now experiencing with Iran’s nuclear technology collaborator, North Korea.
 It bought time to turn into a full-fledged nuclear power under our noses.
 Kerry had promised that the Iranian regime would be prohibited from testing ballistic missiles.
 This turned out to be a lie.
 After the JCPOA was finalized, with no such prohibition included, Iran continued to test such missiles.
 The Obama administration’s response was that the missiles had become a separate issue, to be dealt with under a new United Nations Security Council resolution endorsing the JCPOA.
 The new resolution replaced clear prohibitions imposed on Iran’s ballistic missile program with a weak declaration in an annex that simply “calls upon” Iran not to undertake any activity such as development and test launches related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons for eight years.
 Iran has tested several ballistic missiles during the last two years, including two Qadr H missiles with the phrase “Israel must be wiped out” emblazoned on the sides.
 The commander of Iran’s Army, Major General Ataollah Salehi, had told reporters just a month before the launch of those missiles that Iran was ""neither paying any attention to the resolutions against Iran, nor implementing them.
 This is not a breach of the JCPOA.”
 Russian Ambassador to the United Nations Vitaly Churkin, spurning requests from Obama administration officials to impose sanctions against Iran under the Security Council resolution, asserted that the Iranian missile test did not violate the resolution.
 “A call is different from a ban so legally you cannot violate a call, you can comply with a call or you can ignore the call, but you cannot violate a call,” the Russian ambassador said.
 In short, the JCPOA did not cover the missile tests and the replacement UN Security Council resolution that did mention the missiles is toothless.
 Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes told CNN, during an interview aired on April 6, 2015, that under the deal’s terms then still being negotiated, “you will have anywhere, anytime, 24/7 access as it relates to the nuclear facilities that Iran has.""
 Rhodes claimed that “if we see a site that we need to inspect on a military facility, we can get access to that site and inspect it.
 So if it's a suspicious site that we believe is related to its nuclear efforts, we can get access and inspect that site through the IAEA.” This was another lie.
 After the JCPOA was finalized in July 2015, Rhodes shamelessly denied that anytime, anywhere inspections were ever considered as part of the negotiations.
 “We never sought in this negotiation the capacity for so-called anytime, anywhere,” Rhodes said on July 14, 2015.
 The JCPOA’s supporters, including Kerry, have made much of the fact that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has on several occasions verified Iran’s compliance with its commitments under the JCPOA, keeping its stock of low-enriched uranium below the limit set forth in the JCPOA and not pursuing further construction of the Arak reactor.
 Iran was found to have slightly exceeded the limit on its stock of heavy water, but has remedied the problem to the IAEA’s satisfaction.
 IAEA chief Yukiya Amano reiterated in a statement he issued on October 9th that Iran has remained in compliance with its JCPOA commitments.
 The problem, as any clear-eyed observer of the process recognizes, is that the IAEA relies on Iran for self-inspection of certain sites that the regime does not want the IAEA to inspect freely on its own.
 IAEA inspectors have avoided examining military sites it knows exists and has no reliable way of tracking undeclared sites.
 The IAEA’s explanation for not visiting any of Iran’s known military sites is that it had “no reason to ask” for access.
 Evidently, the IAEA is supposed to block out the fact that Iran had conducted tests relevant to nuclear bomb detonations at a military site before the JCPOA’s finalization in 2015.
 The IAEA should just pretend that such tests could not possibly happen again.
 “Nobody is allowed to visit Iran's military sites,” said Iran’s Head of Strategic Research Center at the Expediency Council and adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, Ali Akbar Velayati.
 Intimidation works.
 The IAEA knows not to ask.
 As to the JCPOA’s sunset provisions, the Obama administration lied about that too.
 Kerry claimed on September 2, 2015 that the JCPOA “never sunsets.
 There’s no sunset in this agreement.”
 This month Kerry has resorted to parsing words.
 He claims the phrase 'sunset provisions' is a “misnomer,” before then defending the JCPOA’s time limits.
 ""We were comfortable because the cap on Iran’s low-enriched uranium stockpile remains in place until 2030,” Kerry wrote in an article published in the Washington Post late last month.
 In other words, let’s just kick the can down the road and hope for a more reasonable Iranian regime in 13 years that would agree to extend the time limits.
 In the meantime, Kerry advises us not to worry.
 Kerry declared, “15 or 25 years from now, we still have the same military options we have today.”
 John Kerry has obviously learned nothing from the North Korean fiasco, which resulted from years of phony agreements with the rogue regime and so-called “strategic patience.” The United States clearly does not have the same military options today to deal with a nuclear armed North Korea as it did 23 years ago when former President Bill Clinton decided not to use military force to stamp out North Korea’s nuclear program at its inception.
 Instead, Clinton started us down the primrose path of naïve diplomacy with a duplicitous regime that now is on the verge of being able to strike the U.S. mainland with nuclear warheads delivered by intercontinental ballistic missiles.
 It is precisely because North Korea’s actions over the last 23 years have proven that making concessions to a rogue regime in order to obtain denuclearization commitments is so dangerous that President Trump does not want to make the same mistake with Iran.
 America’s European allies are also upset with President Trump for refusing to recertify the deal and threatening to pull out if certain conditions are not met.
 British Prime Minister Theresa May, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel issued a joint statement last Friday praising the JCPOA and its implementation.
 They said that the nuclear deal with Iran was “the culmination of 13 years of diplomacy and was a major step towards ensuring that Iran’s nuclear programme is not diverted for military purposes.
 Therefore, we encourage the US Administration and Congress to consider the implications to the security of the US and its allies before taking any steps that might undermine the JCPOA, such as re-imposing sanctions on Iran lifted under the agreement.”
 Perhaps these European leaders should remember their own history.
 Appeasement through phony deals with a rogue dictatorship does not work, as proven by the infamous Munich Pact signed by British and French Prime Ministers Neville Chamberlain and Edouard Daladier with German Chancellor Adolf Hitler seventy-nine years ago.

"Madagascar Plague Outbreak Has Already Killed 57 And Infected Over 600
 
 An outbreak of the plague in Madagascar is spreading at an unprecedented rate.
 With the ease of spreading the plague, the likelihood that this disease will move to other more densely populated regions of the planet has become a huge concern for many.
 So far, the plague has claimed 57 lives and infected more than 680 others.
 These figures are from October 12, however, and the disease is spreading rapidly.
 An estimated 329 of these cases and 25 of the deaths were in the capital city of Antananarivo.
 Of the 684 cases reported as of October 12, 474 were the pneumonic plague, 156 bubonic and 1 septicemic plague.
 A further 54 were unspecified, according to the World Health Organization.
 Of Madagascar’s 114 districts, 35 have reported cases of plague, including at least 10 cities.
 Plague is caused by infection with the bacterium Yersinia pestis and is typically spread through the bite of infected fleas, frequently carried by rats.
 The bacteria will eventually end up causing the often fatal plague.
 Symptoms can include painful, swollen lymph nodes, called buboes, as well as fever, chills, and coughing.
 Pneumonic plague is more virulent or damaging and is an advanced form of the disease characterized by a severe lung infection.
 The infection can be transmitted from person to person via airborne droplets from coughing or sneezing.
 The incubation period is extremely short too, and an infected person may die within 12 to 24 hours of contracting the bacteria making cures in underdeveloped regions of the globe difficult at best.
 According to CNN, the cases were reported by both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Bureau for Risk and Disaster Management (BNGRC) in Madagascar.
 They include probable and suspected cases as well those that have been confirmed by laboratory tests.
 And while the country experiences regular outbreaks, with an estimated 400 cases of plague each year, this time things are very different, experts warn.
 This year, health officials report the infections started much earlier than usual, and they’re occurring in new areas, including urban settings.
 They’ve also seen an unexpected number of cases of pneumonic plague, which transmits more easily from person to person.
 Historically dubbed the “black death” the bubonic plague has been responsible for several worldwide pandemics in the past.
 Early detection of the plague is key since both forms of it can be cured with antibiotics.
 But, occasionally there can be cases of septicemic plague, where the infection has spread to a person’s bloodstream and can cause bleeding and necrosis of tissue, turning it black.
 Internationally, this outbreak is also being taken seriously.
 WHO delivered more than 1.2 million doses of antibiotics and released $1.5 million in emergency funds earlier this month.
 The Red Cross has released more than $1 million to deploy a treatment center and has mobilized more than 1,000 volunteers and is upgrading their skills on community surveillance, finding and monitoring people who have been in contact with infected patients and insightful messaging to stop the spread of this disease.

"THE OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS OF TRUMP'S IRAN INITIATIVE
 
 Originally published the Jerusalem Post.
 On Friday, US President Donald Trump initiated an important change in US policy toward Iran.
 
 No, in his speech decertifying Iran’s compliance with the nuclear accord it struck with his predecessor Barack Obama, Trump didn’t announce a new strategy for preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, or stemming its hegemonic rise in the Middle East, or limiting its ability to sponsor terrorism.
 Trump’s move was not operational.
 It was directional.
 
 In his address Friday, Trump changed the policy dynamics that dictate US policy on Iran.
 For the first time since 2009, when Obama backed the murderous regime in Tehran, spurning the millions of Iranians who rose up in the Green Revolution, Trump opened up the possibility that the US may begin to base its policies toward Iran on reality.
 
 Trump began his remarks by setting out Iran’s long rap sheet of aggression against America.
 
 Starting with the US embassy seizure and hostage crisis, Trump described Iran’s crimes and acts of war against America in greater detail than any of his predecessors ever did.
 
 Trump’s dossier was interlaced with condemnations of the regime’s repression of its own people.
 
 By merging Iran’s external aggression with its internal repression, Trump signaled a readiness to drive a wedge – or expand the wedge – between the authoritarian theocrats that rule Iran and the largely secular, multiethnic and pro-Western people of Iran.
 
 Trump then turned his attention to Iran’s illicit ballistic missile program, its sponsorship of terrorism, including its links to al-Qaida, its aggression against its neighbors, its aggressive acts against maritime traffic in the Straits of Hormuz, and its bids to destabilize and control large swaths of the Middle East through its proxies.
 
 It is notable that these remarks preceded Trump’s discussion of the nuclear deal – which was the ostensible subject of his speech.
 Before Trump discussed Iran’s breaches of the nuclear deal, he first demonstrated that contrary to the expressed views of his top advisers, it is impossible to limit a realistic discussion of the threat Iran constitutes to US national security and interests to whether or not and it what manner it is breaching the nuclear accord.
 
 This was a critical point because for the past two years, US discourse on Iran has focused solely on whether or not Iran was complying with Obama’s nuclear pact.
 By placing the nuclear deal in the context of Iran’s consistent, overarching hostility and aggression, Trump made it self-evident that no US interest is served in continuing to give Iran a free pass from congressional sanctions.
 
 After accomplishing that goal, Trump turned his attention to how Iran is actually breaching the letter and spirit of the nuclear pact.
 Only then, almost as an afterthought, did he announce that he was decertifying Iranian compliance with the nuclear deal, setting the conditions for the renewal of congressional sanctions on Iran and opening the floodgates of congressional sanctions on Iran in retaliation for the full spectrum of its aggressive and illicit acts against the US, its interests and allies.
 
 By empowering Congress to prohibit economic cooperation with Iran, Trump put the Europeans, Chinese and Russians on notice that they may soon face a choice between conducting business with the US and conducting business with Iran.
 
 After putting them on notice, Trump discussed the possibility of improving Obama’s nuclear accord.
 Among other things, he suggested expanding the inspection regime against Iran’s nuclear installations and canceling the so-called “sunset” clause that places an end date on the restrictions governing certain components of Iran’s nuclear advancement.
 
 Trump’s address has the potential to serve as the foundation of a major, positive shift in US policy toward Iran.
 Such a shift could potentially facilitate the achievement of Trump’s goals of preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, containing its regional aggression and empowerment and defeating its terrorist proxies.
 
 Unfortunately, it is also likely, indeed, it is more likely, that his words will not be translated into policies to achieve these critical aims.
 
 Trump’s decision to transfer immediate responsibility to Congress for holding Iran accountable for its hostile actions on the military and other fronts is a risky move.
 He has a lot of enemies, and the nuclear deal has a lot of supporters on Capitol Hill.
 
 Obama would have never been able to implement his nuclear deal if Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, hadn’t agreed to cast the Constitution aside and ignore Obama’s constitutional duty to present the nuclear deal to the Senate for ratification as a treaty.
 
 Over the past week, Trump and Corker have been involved in an ugly public fight precipitated by Corker’s announcement that he will not be seeking reelection next year.
 
 Today Corker has nothing to restrain him from scuttling Trump’s agenda.
 If he wishes, out of spite, Corker can block effective sanctions from being passed.
 And he may do so even though the implications for his Senate colleagues would be dire and even though doing so would render him an unofficial protector of Iran’s nuclear program.
 
 What is true for Corker is doubly true for the Democrats.
 
 Leading Democratic senators like Robert Menendez, Ben Cardin and Chuck Schumer, who opposed Obama’s Iran deal may now feel that as opponents of the Trump administration, they are required to oppose any change to the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act.
 
 Indeed, given the rise of radical forces in their party it is likely that they would rather give Iran a free pass for its anti-American aggression and nuclear proliferation than work with Republicans on Capitol Hill and in the White House.
 
 Then again, by framing the issue of Iran’s threat to America as he did, and by transferring responsibility for reinstating sanctions and passing further sanctions on Iran to Congress, Trump opened up the possibility that Congress will conduct substantive – rather than personal – debates on Iran.
 
 And the more substantive those debates become, the further away the US discourse will move from the mendacious assumptions of Obama’s Iran policy – that the Iranian regime is a responsible actor and potential US ally, and that there is nothing inherently aggressive or problematic about Iran’s illicit nuclear weapons program.
 
 The second major risk inherent in Trump’s approach is that he will get his way; that the Europeans, Russians and Chinese and the Iranians will agree to improve the nuclear deal.
 The problem here is not obvious.
 Clearly, it is better if the deal is amended to delete the sunset clauses and expand the inspections regime.
 
 Yet even an amended, improved deal will still serve as a shield to Iran’s nuclear program.
 An improved deal won’t destroy Iran’s centrifuges.
 
 It won’t take away Iran’s enriched uranium.
 It won’t destroy Iran’s nuclear installations.
 And it won’t bring down the regime which by its nature ensures all of these things will remain a menace to the US, its allies and international security as a whole.
 
 So long as the US continues to maintain a policy based on the false view that all that is necessary to destroy the threat of a nuclear armed Iran is a combination of the nuclear deal and economic sanctions, it will continue to ensure that Iran and its nuclear program remain a major threat.
 Distressingly, US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, the most outspoken supporter of decertifying Iranian compliance in the Trump administration, told NBC on Sunday that the US intends to remain in the nuclear deal.
 
 To understand what must be done we must return to Trump’s speech and its strategic significance.
 
 By taking a holistic view of the Iranian threat – grounded in a recognition of the inherent hostility of the regime – Trump opened up the possibility that the US and its allies can develop a holistic policy for confronting and defeating Iran and its proxies.
 If the Iran deal and sanctions are two components to a larger strategy rather than the entire strategy, they can be helpful.
 
 A wider strategy would target Iran’s regional aggression by weakening its proxies and clients from Hezbollah and Hamas to the regimes in Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Lebanon.
 It would target the regime itself by empowering the ayatollahs’ domestic opponents.
 It would pin down Iranian forces by arming and otherwise assisting the Iraqi Kurds to defend and maintain their control over their territory along the Iranian border while strengthening the ties between Iranian Kurds and Iraqi Kurds.
 
 Friday, Trump created the possibility for such a strategy.
 It is up to members of Congress, and US allies like Israel and the Sunni Arab states to help Trump conceive and implement it.
 If they fail, the possibility Trump created will be lost, perhaps irrevocably.

"Iranian Aggression Intensifies
 
 Last July, Major General Mohammad Bagheri, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) military commander and chief of staff of Iran’s armed forces, warned that “putting the Revolutionary Guard in the terrorist lists with terrorist groups can be very costly to the United States and its military bases and forces in the region.” IRGC commander Mohammad Ali Jafari said on October 8th that ""if the news is correct about the stupidity of the American government in considering the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist group, then the Revolutionary Guards will consider the American army to be like Islamic State all around the world.""
 The next day the Iranian regime warned of a ""crushing"" response if the United States were to designate the IRGC as a terrorist organization.
 President Trump has called the Iranian regime’s bluff with his announcement last week that he would do just that.
 Designating the IRGC as a terrorist organization and imposing new sanctions for its aggressive actions in the region is not a restoration of the sanctions lifted by the Obama administration as part of its disastrous nuclear deal with Iran.
 If Iran insists it can do what it wants militarily in terms of missile launches, support of terrorist groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas, and arms transfers without violating the nuclear deal, then the United States can certainly act to curb such activities through financial pressure.
 The U.S. can impose sanctions against the Iranian regime’s principal instrument for projecting aggressive, destabilizing force outside of its borders without violating the nuclear deal.
 The Iranian regime does not see it that way, however.
 With the lifting of the nuclear-related sanctions making available billions of dollars to Iran’s leaders to further finance the IRGC’s exploits in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and elsewhere, the regime is furious that the Trump administration is tightening the financial screws again, even if for reasons not directly related to Iran’s compliance with the terms of the nuclear deal.
 Thus, it is threatening U.S. forces and bases in the region.
 A couple of seemingly unrelated events this past week point to Iran’s positioning itself for more aggressive military actions that could place U.S. forces in harm’s way.
 On Tuesday, Major General Bagheri landed in Damascus for talks with Syrian President Bashar Assad and senior Syrian officials, including the defense minister and the chief of staff of the Syrian armed forces.
 Bagheri is quoted as saying that his visit’s purpose was to “put a joint strategy on continuing co-ordination and co-operation at the military level.” Some experts on Iran believe that Bagheri’s visit to Damascus at this time is intended to reinforce a message that Iran will continue to supply weaponry to Syria and to reinforce the presence of its terrorist proxy Hezbollah in Syria.
 This will not only serve to bolster the Assad regime, but it also will strengthen Iran's ability to follow through on its threats to the U.S. and its allies, principally Israel.
 Meanwhile, following the departure of the Kurds from Kirkuk, Iraq earlier this week, the IRGC’s operational Al Qods arm reportedly established a command center and five bases there.
 According to Debkafile, this constitutes “the first military facility Iran has ever established openly in Iraq.” The Kirkuk region holds 45 percent of Iraqi’s oil.
 The Iraqi branch of Iran’s terrorist proxy Hezbollah has vowed that once ISIS is defeated it will start killing Americans, as it has done before.
 It is against this backdrop that U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley used her entire speech to the UN Security Council on Wednesday to denounce the Iranian regime on multiple grounds.
 The session was supposed to be devoted to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but Ambassador Haley departed from the monthly ritual during which Israel is normally singled out for criticism by other Council members.
 She went after Iran instead.
 She explained why the Trump administration decided to take “a comprehensive approach to confronting the Iranian regime,” which does not give the regime a get out of jail free card even if it is in technical compliance with the loophole-ridden nuclear deal agreed to by the Obama administration.
 “We can’t talk about stability in the Middle East without talking about Iran,” Ambassador Haley said.
 “That’s because nearly every threat to peace and security in the Middle East is connected to Iran’s outlaw behavior.
 The United States has now embarked on a course that attempts to address all aspects of Iran’s destructive conduct, not just one aspect.
 It’s critical that the international community do the same.
 Judging Iran by the narrow confines of the nuclear deal misses the true nature of the threat.
 Iran must be judged in totality of its aggressive, destabilizing, and unlawful behavior.
 To do otherwise would be foolish.”
 Ambassador Haley accused the Iranian regime of continuing to “play” the Security Council.
 “Iran hides behind its assertion of technical compliance with the nuclear deal while it brazenly violates the other limits on its behavior.
 And we have allowed them to get away with it.
 This must stop.”
 Ambassador Haley proceeded to list various violations by the Iranian regime of Security Council resolutions pertaining to the transfer of conventional weapons from Iran and the arming of terrorist groups, including the Houthi rebels in Yemen and Hezbollah.
 She also pointed to what she called the Iranian regime’s “most threatening act” – its launch of ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons.
 “When a rogue regime starts down the path of ballistic missiles, it tells us that we will soon have another North Korea on our hands,” Ambassador Haley said.
 “If it is wrong for North Korea to do this, why doesn’t that same mentality apply to Iran?
 “
 As for the Iran’s supposed technical compliance with its commitments under the nuclear deal itself, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the UN’s international inspectors are not able to visit Iran’s military sites.
 Past work on nuclear explosive trigger devices appears to have taken place at one or more such sites in the past.
 International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Yukiya Amano admitted last month that when it comes to the IAEA’s capacity to check whether Iran was conducting work on a nuclear explosive device, his agency’s “tools are limited.” The Iranian regime has also attempted to skirt the restrictions in the JCPOA on its procurement of materials, equipment, goods and technology related to Iran’s nuclear activities.
 The Heritage Foundation noted in its recent report on the JCPOA, for example, that Iran was “caught red-handed trying to purchase nuclear technology and restricted ballistic missile technology from German companies.”
 U.S. intelligence had discovered North Korea’s transfer of missile parts to Iran at the very same time that Iran was negotiating the nuclear deal, in clear violation of UN Security Council resolutions then in effect.
 The Obama administration chose to look the other way.
 Does anybody with a modicum of sense really believe that such collaboration between the two rogue nations is not going on today?
 Iran is flush with cash, thanks to the JCPOA.
 It wants to build out its missile and nuclear enrichment capabilities.
 In addition to covert transfers of materials and technology to Iran in violation of the nuclear deal, the JCPOA may provide a loophole for Iran to exploit in outsourcing some of the development work to North Korea for hard currency, which North Korea desperately needs.
 They are a perfect match for each other.
 Proponents of the JCPOA argue that exiting the nuclear deal unless it is changed to the Trump administration’s satisfaction would undermine U.S. credibility with North Korea and thereby kill any chance of negotiations to resolve the crisis caused by North Korea's continued testing of sophisticated nuclear arms and ballistic missiles.
 ""If we want to talk to North Korea now, the possible end for the nuclear deal with Iran would jeopardize the credibility of such treaties,"" Reuters quoted German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel as saying.
 Germany is one of the parties to the JCPOA.
 Other European allies have voiced similar concerns.
 So have Obama’s former Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry.
 This argument is absurd on its face.
 The whole point is to prevent Iran from becoming the next North Korea, not to kick the can down the road as usual.
 North Korea’s aggressive pursuit of nuclear weapons and of intercontinental ballistic missiles equipped with nuclear warheads proves that weak agreements full of front-loaded goodies rewarding rogue regimes for elusive promises are worthless.

"Madagascar Hospitals On High Alert: ‘No One Is Safe’ From The Black Plague
 
 Travelers are being warned to keep their distance from areas of Madagascar affected by the bubonic plague.
 As the outbreak worsens, some doctors are even warning that “no one is safe” from the disease.
 The outbreak of the black plague in Madagascar has so far killed 97 people, and doctors are warning that it will be continuing to spread and worsen, meaning no one is safe.
 Health officials say the disease, which contributed to the deaths of more than 50 million people in Europe during the Middle Ages, has spread from rural areas to the more urban areas not usually affected.
 Hundreds of cases are reported on the tropical island every year, but experts are warning the epidemic is “much more dangerous” than in previous years.
 Officials have reported infections in 17 of the island nation’s 22 regions since the outbreak started in August.
 And the number of cases is growing by the day, said Elhadj As Sy, the secretary general of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) as the nation put all hospitals on high alert.
 The hospitals have also begun implementing preventative measures with attempts to stall the spread of the bacterial infection.
 The IFRC said it’s introducing the same “safe and dignified” burial methods used in West Africa during the 2014 Ebola epidemic.
 This helps cut the chain of transmission by preventing further infections through direct contact with infected corpses.
 Last week, less than 60 people had died and around 600 had been infected.
 Now, there are 911 confirmed cases in addition to the almost 100 deaths.
 While cases of bubonic plague occur in Madagascar nearly every year, the much more dangerous and deadly pneumonic plague has never been so prevalent.
 It arrived earlier than expected this year, and has become much more contagious with it being transmitted from person to person through the air.
 Pneumonic plague is the most life-threatening form of the infection caused by the manifestation of a Yersinia pestis bacterial infection.
 Although the black plague can be treated effectively with antibiotics, the incubation time of this bacteria is incredibly short.
 Death often occurs within 12-24 hours of becoming infected.
 The bubonic strain of the disease is spread through the bites of infected fleas, whereas the more contagious and deadly pneumonic type is spread through the coughing or sneezing of an infected person.
 Elhadj As Sy said that overcoming the epidemic would require long-term help, not “just intervening at the peak and then forgetting about it”.
 Dr. Manitra Rakotoarivony, Madagascar’s director of health promotion, said: “Normally, people who catch the plague live in poor areas, but people in every place in society are catching the disease.”
 Jimmy Whitworth, professor of International Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told The Sun: “It has been a long time since we have seen the plague in an urban environment.
 Although health officials have said that internationally, the threat is still fairly low, they’ve also said no one in Madagascar is safe, including travelers, spiking concerns over a possible global pandemic.

"It’s Airborne: Officials Warn That The “Black Death” Plague Could Spread Rapidly
 
 The fears that the “black death” would spread from Madagascar have now taken hold.
 As nations grapple with the outbreak of the bubonic plague, nine countries are sounding warnings that the disease is spreading rapidly.
 The deadly plague outbreak that has struck Madagascar’s major cities has yet to “peak” and that could make the spread of this infection into the surrounding regions more likely.
 Dr. Ashok Chopra, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Texas, told The Sun Online the crisis in Madagascar had yet to peak.
 He also sounded the alarm to neighboring countries.
 Since there are regular flights in and out of Madagascar and this outbreak has so far, been impossible to contain, other nations are now at risk.
 Speaking from Madagascar, Christine South, head of IFRC’s (International Federation of Red Cross) emergency operations, said: “With anything like this there is a possibility that somebody could be infected and get on a plane.
 We have done preparedness support to some of the neighboring countries.” Tourists have been warned to stay out of Madagascar until doctors can get the plague under control to prevent its spread.
 The outbreak is considered a much bigger threat to the region than in previous years because it has taken on its pneumonic form.
 That means it is airborne and spread by sneezing and coughing.
 Not only that, but the plague has a very short incubation time.
 Once exposed, some people will die within 24 hours.
 Experts say the epidemic could still worsen as the death tolls hit 124 and more than 1,300 are left infected.
 The World Health Organization (WHO) has now issued alarming warnings in nine countries too.
 “If they are traveling shorter distances and they’re still in the incubation period, and they have the pneumonic (form) then they could spread it to other places,” said Chopra.
 “We don’t want to have a situation where the disease spreads so fast it sort of gets out of control.
 Most of the cases in the past have been of the bubonic plague but if you look at this particular outbreak, 70 percent of the cases are pneumonic plague, which is the most deadly form of the disease.
 If the treatment is not given in a very short period of time these people will end up dying.”
 Both forms of the plague can be cured with antibiotics, but getting treatment quickly is the key to survival.

"The Plague Is AIRBORNE And It’s Spreading Because People Are Literally ‘Dancing With Corpses’
 
 The plague that’s airborne and has killed at least 124 people in Madagascar is now blamed on “dancing with corpses.” This is the time of year when the dead are wrapped in sheets and paraded through the streets while others dance around the bodies.
 The local tradition is said to be one of the major causes of the spread of this disease.
 Since it’s airborne, anyone coming close to the corpse of a person who has died of the black death could themselves, catch the infection.
 Health officials suspect it’s no coincidence that the outbreak coincides with the time of year when families customarily exhume the remains of dead relatives, wrap them in a sheet, and dance with them through the streets in a sacred ritual, AFP reports.
 “If a person dies of pneumonic plague and is then interred in a tomb that is subsequently opened for [the ritual], the bacteria can still be transmitted and contaminate whoever handles the body,” said Willy Randriamarotia, Madagascar’s health ministry chief of staff.
 Some locals believe the whole plague is some kind of a government conspiracy, and say they have no intention of forgoing the ritual known as “famadihana.” They say they will continue to dance with the dead and intend to honor their ancestors.
 “I will always practice the turning of the bones of my ancestors — plague or no plague.
 The plague is a lie,” Helene Raveloharisoa told the wire service.
 Josephine Ralisiarisoa firmly believes the country’s cash-strapped government is just exaggerating the problem to get money ahead of an election next year.
 And it isn’t that anyone is putting this past a government to lie for profits, but health officials have even warned tourists, a source of money, to stay away from Madagascar for their own health.
 “I have participated in at least 15 famadihana ceremonies in my life.
 And I’ve never caught the plague,” she told the AFP.

 Kritarch Patti Saris is in the news again.
 She is one of many Federal District Court Judges who want to run immigration policy, despite the fact that the Constitution gives authority over immigration to Congress, and Congress has allocated considerable authority to the President.
 This writer exposed her attempted violation of the Constitution after she initially stopped the deportation of a number of Indonesians back to Indonesia as she saw it unjust and decided to substitute her moral judgment for the laws of the United States.
 Kritarch Patti Saris
 Federal courts do not have direct authority over immigration matters, which are handled by the Executive Office for Immigration Review, but Chief Judge Patti Saris of the US District Court in Boston wrote in a court filing on Wednesday that she has a say over the terms of his confinement.
 US Judge Rejects Bid to Dismiss Indonesian Immigrant's Lawsuit, Jakarta Globe/Reuters, October 25, 2017
 ""The district court holds jurisdiction to review habeas [corpus] challenges to unlawful immigration detention,"" Saris wrote.
 Writs of habeas corpus challenge illegal detention.
 At a Friday hearing, Saris expressed concern that ICE had broken its word with Rombot after telling him in 2015 that he would ""be given an opportunity to prepare for an orderly departure"" before being deported.
 She also expressed concern he was being held alongside potentially violent criminals.
 Her problem though was that the law and precedent are on the side of the continued deportation of aliens.
 Kritarch Saris has apparently seen the SCOTUS writing on the wall, and perhaps had an attack of her legal conscience and decided that she will acquiesce on the major issue, but fight on a minor issue.
 Commonly this the pattern of Judges who don't want to be overruled as frequently as 9th Circuit Judges do.
 Saris has apparently decided to bend to the inevitable in the case of Indonesians, who had years of hearings and appeals, all to naught, but do a little sabotage instead.However, she will not let it go quietly into the night.What we have here is that Saris realized she has no authority over the deportation of illegal aliens, but she will do her best to throw a wrench in the works by attempting to get illegal aliens released from custody, so they can then disappear into the United States and consequently not be deported.
 (a) Arrest, detention, and release On a warrant issued by the Attorney General, an alien may be arrested and detained pending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed from the United States.
 Except as provided in subsection (c) and pending such decision, the Attorney General—(1) may continue to detain the arrested alien
 One of the immigrants, Terry Helmuth Rombot, has been in federal custody since appearing for an August check-in.
 Lawyers submitted a letter to him from ICE saying that as part of the 2010 deal he would be allowed to leave the country in an “orderly” way.
 “ICE decided that the most orderly way for him to depart was for us to remove him,” Stevens said.
 Saris expressed a dim view of that move.
 “The government broke a promise,” Saris said.
 “That’s the thing I‘m concerned about here.” U.S. Judge Wrestles With Issue Of Indonesian Immigrants, by Scott Malone, Reuters, October 20, 2017
 However, the law is quite clear, the United States has the authority to detain illegal aliens; T itle 8 of the United States Code, Section 1226, Arrest And Detention Of Aliens , gives such authority to the Executive Branch.And despite her realization that she has no authority over immigration policy, or that she will just be overruled, Saris again reaches, basing her assumption of authority over immigration based on the past Obama Regime Administrative Amnesty , when illegal aliens weren't deported.Kritarch Saris is in the wrong on both counts; she has neither authority over the detention of illegal aliens nor any authority to continue the Obama Regime Administrative Amnesty.
 She is like Derrick Kahala Watson , a treasonous kritarch, unwilling to submit her hunger for power and ideology to the Constitution and the law.
 Impeachment for her and Watson is the solution.

"Officials Warn: Airborne Black Death Epidemic Could ‘Explode’
 
 The bubonic plague outbreak that is taking Madagascar to its knees will more than likely last another six months.
 But the worst news is that the epidemic could explode anytime unleashing the sickness on the globe.
 At least 128 people have been killed and more than 1,300 infected by the deadlier pneumonic strain of the medieval disease.
 But the oncoming rainy season could see the number of those infected explode exponentially.
 The rainy season poses a threat to the containment of the plague because outbreaks of this magnitude often seem to be seasonal.
 The Foreign Office recently warned that the deadly outbreak is entering its most dangerous phase.
 Its website said that “outbreaks of plague tend to be seasonal and occur mainly during the rainy season.” The African island’s wet season officially began today and will last until the end of April, meaning the downward trend the plague had seen over the past few days, will likely turn upward again.
 Because the disease can be spread easily through a cough or sneeze, experts are fearful.
 It would take just one infected traveler who made it to Africa’s mainland or even nearby British honeymoon paradises like Mauritius, the Maldives or the Seychelles to spread the disease globally.
 The Seychelles is currently putting anyone traveling from Madagascar into quarantine on arrival as a precaution.
 The outbreak has been fueled by performing the ancient practice of Famadihana.
 Famadihana is the “dancing with the dead” ritual which sees locals dig up deceased relatives and dance with them before they are reburied.
 Just contact with a corpse who’s death was because they contracted the plague could sicken a person.
 The country’s health chief Willy Randriamarotia said: “If a person dies of pneumonic plague and is then interred in a tomb that is subsequently opened for a Famadihana, the bacteria can still be transmitted and contaminate whoever handles the body.” The tradition has been banned since the outbreak began, but it is feared ceremonies have taken place regardless as local continue to balk that their rituals have contributed to the outbreak.
 This latest warning that the rainy season could worsen the outbreak comes on the heels of the reports that British aid workers said the epidemic will get worse before it gets better.
 Olivier Le Guillou of Action Against Hunger said: “The epidemic is ahead of us, we have not yet reached the peak.”
 As many as 50 aid workers are believed to have been among the 1,200 people infected with the more dangerous airborne pneumonic strain of the disease.

"New Virus With NO CURE Spreading: This Is WORSE Than The ‘Black Death’
 
 A new virus for which medical officials have no remedy is spreading.
 The infectious disease also has a fatality rate of almost 90% making it much more deadly than the black death plaguing Madagascar.
 A deadly outbreak of a rare and highly fatal virus has broken out in eastern Uganda and five cases have already been identified, the World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed.
 The disease is known as the Marburg virus.
 It is similar to the Ebola virus and can be fatal in up to 88% of cases.
 The outbreak of the contagious and deadly Marburg virus disease in the Kween district of eastern Uganda was declared by the nation’s Ministry of Health back on October 19.
 Since then, five cases have been identified as international aid agencies, stretched thin by Madagascar’s black death outbreak, have rushed to deploy teams on the ground to control the recent outbreak.
 This news comes amid a surge in cases of plague in Madagascar, which is considered to be the “worst outbreak in 50 years” and now at “crisis” point.
 Marburg virus disease (MVD), which causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever, ranks among the most virulent pathogens known to infect humans, according to the World Health Organization.
 The WHO website reads: “Marburg virus disease is a rare disease with a high mortality rate for which there is no specific treatment.
 The virus is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, body fluids, and tissues of infected persons or wild animals (e.g.
 monkeys and fruit bats).” MVD also falls within the same family as the Ebola virus – the hemorrhagic fever that decimated West Africa and killed around 11,000 in 2014 and 2015.
 The outbreak is thought to have begun in September when a man in his 30s, who worked as a game hunter and lived near a cave with a heavy presence of bats, was admitted to a local health center with a high fever, vomiting, and diarrhea.
 The man’s condition deteriorated quickly and he failed to respond to antimalarial treatments.
 He died after being taken to another hospital, and a short time later, his sister in her 50’s also died of the same ailment.
 Emergency screening has begun at the Kenya-Uganda border in Turkana after all three members of the same family died of the disease in Uganda.
 Health workers have been asked to work with communities to stop the deadly Marburg outbreak from devastating communities in the rural region.
 Dr. Zabulon Yoti, a Technical Coordinator for Emergencies at the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Africa, said: “Community engagement is the cornerstone of emergency response.” He urged health officials to “work with the communities to build their capacity for success and sustainability” and develop a better understanding of the local customs and traditions.
 Early symptoms include fever, chills, headache, and myalgia (muscle pain).
 Several hundred people have been exposed to the virus as officials worry this outbreak could spread rapidly into regions already devastated by the ongoing black death outbreak.

 Years ago numerous Indonesian Christians came illegally to the United States and submitted asylum applications.
 Those asylum applications were reviewed by the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), the immigration courts.
 The claims were rejected as unsubstantiated and the illegal aliens ordered deported.
 However, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) declined to enforce those deportation orders, called Final Order Of Removal
 During the 10 or so years that the cases involving Indonesian Christians were free to remain in the United States, those illegal aliens did not make any effort to appeal their outstanding orders.
 Then the United States had an election, and the policy of not enforcing those and many other Final Orders of Removal was ended.
 Then suddenly, those illegal aliens claimed they were being denied an opportunity to file for asylum or were not receiving due process.
 They filed a case in the Federal courts and were assigned to a Kritarch, Patti Saris, who apparently thinks she runs immigration policy, even after aliens have had their day in court.
 Saris thinks she can usurp the Constitution of the United States based on her whims regarding immigration policy.
 Kritarch Patti Saris
 In her latest excursion into immigration enforcement policy, she decided that illegal aliens can't be held in custody for their return to their home country.
 BOSTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Wednesday ordered the release of an illegal immigrant who is among 47 Indonesians in New Hampshire challenging the Trump administration’s order to deport them.
 The man, Terry Rombot, had been allowed to remain under the terms of a 2010 deal with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement until this year, when President Donald Trump instructed ICE that all people living in the United States illegally were subject to deportation.
 [U.S. Judge Frees Indonesian Immigrant Held By Trump Order, by Nate Raymond, Reuters, November 1, 2017]
 First, let's deal with the misleading reporting.
 Rombot was not taken into custody based on any ICE policy of deporting all illegal aliens.
 Rombot was taken into custody because he had an outstanding Final Order Of Removal; that's a big difference and symptomatic of the lies from reporters like Raymond.
 Saris previously ordered a stay to the deportations.
 She is currently weighing whether she can order a longer delay to give the affected people time to renew their efforts to gain legal status.
 Now, with regard to Saris, she has no authority to interfere with the pre-deportation custody of an illegal alien with a Final Order Of Removal.
 Rombot was taken into custody because he was soon to be deported.
 There was no issue of Indonesia not accepting him nor of Indonesia not providing a travel document, so there was no question of him being held in custody longer than allowed in the St. Cyr decision that restricted custody of illegal aliens with Final Orders Of Removal who for whatever reason were unlikely to be successfully deported.
 She still thinks that she can review the underlying decision of the immigration court as well.In fact, Saris' actions appear to more akin to that of the Mexican kritarch Monica Herranz who aided an illegal alien to escape arrest by ICE when she let that illegal alien leave her courtroom through the exit to her judicial chambers.
 Saris is clearly scheming to help Rombot escape deportation by disappearing into the almost 1 million illegal aliens absconding from Final Orders of Removal
 Time for Congress to impeach Saris and to remove authority from lesser courts to review immigration law enforcement, detention, and deportation decisions.

"Deadly Plague Could MUTATE And Become Untreatable As It Spreads Globally
 
 The pneumonic plague has already infected 2,000 in Madagascar and killed 143 in the country’s worst outbreak in 50 years.
 But health officials are now warning the deadly bacteria could mutate and become untreatable as it spreads across the globe.
 Coupled with the high likelihood that this disease could spread globally by an infected traveler getting on a plane to Europe or America, health officials are now warning that the strain of plague which has already killed more than 140 Madagascar could mutate and become untreatable.
 Professor Paul Hunter has warned that, while it would be rather easy for an advanced country to contain the disease in its current form, he fears that it could evolve into something far more dangerous.
 Hunter, who is a disease expert at the University of East Anglia, told the Daily Star: “If it reaches the UK, Europe or the US it would be similar to the Ebola outbreak.
 We would have a few isolated cases but it shouldn’t spread like it has in Madagascar.” But he had more to add.
 “As with any disease, it’s a real worry that it mutates and become untreatable,” Hunter said.
 So far, the majority of the recent cases of the black death have the been pneumonic plague, a more deadly form of the bubonic plague which devastated Europe’s population in the 1300s.
 While the bubonic plague is spread through the bites of infected fleas, pneumonic plague is spread through the air, usually by coughing.
 Airborne infections are difficult at best to control.
 Symptoms of the plague include a very high fever, coughing (potentially coughing up blood), and headaches.
 Ten African nations have already been put on alert that the plague could easily spread to their region of the globe.
 The plague can be fatal 24-48 hours after infection, but antibiotics will take care of the infection.
 Schools and universities have been closed with a ban issued on public gatherings, such as the tradition of “dancing with the dead” which has been partially blamed for the disease’s spread.
 The current outbreak is also highly unusual as it has affected urban areas increasing the risk of transmission, according to the World Health Organization.
 WHO has delivered 1.2 million doses of antibiotics to fight the disease while the Red Cross has been training hundreds of volunteers on the island to publicize preventative measures.

"Black Death: ‘It’s 100 % Likely’ It Spreads To The UK And A ‘Ticking Time Bomb’ Ready To Decimate The World
 
 The death toll in Madagascar due to the plague has jumped for the first time since health officials claimed the infection was in the beginning stages of control.
 With the new uptick in those who died, the fear that the disease will spread to the United Kingdom has been confirmed as “100 percent likely.”
 The plague death toll has now shown signs that it’s picking up speed again.
 Official figures reveal 165 people have now lost their lives in Madagascar’s “worst outbreak in 50 years.” Recent data shows a 15 percent jump in fatalities over just three days, coupled with scientists concerned that the black death has reached a “crisis” point.
 Ten other African countries have also been placed on high alert, warning that an outbreak could occur at any time.
 At least 2,034 people have been infected down by a more lethal form of the black death so far in the country, which lies off the coast of Africa, according to WHO statistics.
 Some experts fear the disease (which is so deadly because it is airborne) could mutate and become untreatable during this year’s outbreak – which is expected to blight Madagascar until April.
 Others worry the plague will go beyond mainland Africa and eventually reach the US, Europe, and Britain.
 The plague spreads easily and can kill within 48 hours.
 That would leave millions more vulnerable to the outbreak, and create a short supply of life-saving antibiotics.
 According to the Daily Mail, experts warn the outbreak of plague in Madagascar this year is being fueled by a strain more lethal than the one which usually strikes the country.
 This form of the pneumonic plague is airborne, easily spread by a cough or a sneeze, and has been responsible for two-thirds of all infections this year.
 The bubonic form of the plague, responsible for the “Black Death” in the 14th century strikes the country each year and infects around 600 people.
 But with over 2000 alread infected by pneumonic plague (and counting) health officials aren’t willing to quit sounding alarms just yet.
 Paul Hunter, a professor of health protection at the world-renowned University of East Anglia, was the first expert to predict the plague could travel across the sea.
 He previously said: “The big anxiety is it could spread to mainland Africa, it’s not probable, but certainly possible, that might then be difficult to control.
 If we don’t carry on doing stuff here, at one point something will happen and it will get out of our control and cause huge devastation all around the world.” There is always a risk with travel that the disease will spread globally, Hunter added.
 “We don’t want a situation where the disease spreads so fast it gets out of control.
 We are talking about it spreading in days rather than weeks.” But Hunter is adamant that a well-developed country could manage the plague should a global outbreak occur.
 Hopefully, most will never have to find out how well another country can manage this infection.
 A few health experts have warned that there is no threat to the UK, however, some have warned the plague outbreak will certainly spread to the region.
 Richard Conroy, the founder of Sick Holiday, has sent a chilling warning to UK authorities.
 Conway is saying it’s “only a matter of time” before the disease arrives on British soil.
 Conroy warned it is inevitable that the plague will spread due to the vast movement of people across the globe.
 “I believe that it’s 100 percent likely that plague will arrive in the UK once more – it’s just a question of ‘when’, not ‘if’.
 And it’s not an exaggeration to say that this is a real threat – a ticking time bomb that’s waiting to decimate the world,” Conroy continued.
 “With the current outbreak still remaining treatable with antibiotics, however, the current risk is low.”

"House of Representatives Paid $15,000,000 To Sexual Harassment Victims
 
 Did you know that the House of Representatives has paid out $15,000,000 to victims of sexual harassment in recent years?
 I am going to share some things with you in this article that are deeply disturbing, but it is for a purpose.
 The status quo is not acceptable in Washington, and once people truly understand how deep the corruaption runs I believe that they will get motivated to finally drain the swamp once and for all.
 So yes, I am going to share some things in this article that are truly disgusting, but the goal is to show you that it is time to take our government back from the corrupt career politicians that are completely and utterly out of control.
 In recent days, CNN has interviewed dozens of people that worked on Capitol Hill, and almost every single one of them had stories of sexual harassment to share…
 CNN spoke with more than 50 lawmakers, current and former Hill aides and political veterans who have worked in Congress, the majority of whom spoke anonymously to be candid and avoid potential repercussions.
 With few exceptions, every person said they have personally experienced sexual harassment on the Hill or know of others who have.
 In an environment with “so many young women,” said one ex-House aide, the men “have no self-control.” “Amongst ourselves, we know,” a former Senate staffer said of the lawmakers with the worst reputations.
 And sometimes, the sexual advances from members of Congress or senior aides are reciprocated in the hopes of advancing one’s career — what one political veteran bluntly referred to as a “sex trade on Capitol Hill.”
 The American people are not going to put up with this any longer.
 We have no choice but to clean up our government because the rest of the world is laughing at us.
 On Tuesday, U.S. Representative Jackie Speier told a congressional hearing that she personally knows of two current members of Congress that have “engaged in sexual harassment”…
 “In fact there are two members of Congress, Republican and Democrat, right now, who serve — who have…engaged in sexual harassment.” Speier said one of the harassers has propositioned women with the comment, “Are you going to be a good girl?” Another has exposed his genitals, she said, and some victims have had “their private parts grabbed on the House floor.” “All they ask in return as staff members is to be able to work in a hostile-free work environment.
 They want the system fixed and the perpetrators held accountable.”
 And Speier was the one that revealed the fact that 15 million dollars have been paid out to victims of sexual harassment in the House in recent years.
 The following comes from Breitbart…
 Rep. Jackie Speier (D-CA) told MSNBC’s Chuck Todd on Meet the Press Daily on Tuesday that the U.S. House of Representatives has paid $15 million to alleged victims of sexual harassment by its own members in recent years.
 “We do know there is about $15 million that has been paid out by the House on behalf of harassers in the last ten to 15 years,” she said.
 “15 million dollars has been paid out over sexual harassment claims,” Todd replied, somewhat shocked.
 “So, obviously more than one member of Congress.”
 If members of Congress are engaged in this type of behavior, why don’t the American people know about it?
 And why are those members of Congress still allowed to serve?
 Representative Barbara Comstock also testified on Tuesday.
 She said that one current member of Congress exposed his private parts to a female staffer when she delivered papers to his house…
 Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.) said at a House Administration Committee hearing on Tuesday that a sitting member of the U.S. Congress exposed himself to a young female staffer who delivered papers to his house–at his request.
 We need to be told who this member of Congress is so that he can be removed from Congress immediately.
 This kind of behavior is not acceptable for anyone in a civilized society – and that goes double for someone that is supposed to be one of the leaders of our nation.
 Here are the exact words that Comstock used as she described this incident…
 This member asked a staffer to bring them over some materials, to their residence.
 And the young staffer — it was a young woman — went there and was greeted with a member in a towel.
 It was a male, who then invited her in.
 And at that point, he decided to expose himself.
 She left, and then she quit her job.
 She left, she found another job.
 Of course, this sort of behavior is not just limited to members of Congress.
 According to an ex-Secret Service agent, Vice-President Joe Biden was regularly engaged in “Weinstein-level” predatory behavior…
 An ex-Secret Service agent is claiming that former Vice President Joe Biden engaged in “Weinstein-level” sexual assault and that he would walk around the VP residence late at night completely naked.
 According to Big League Politics’ Cassandra Fairbanks, a Secret Service agent who spoke on condition of anonymity revealed that Biden “would mess with every single woman or teen,” and that a Christmas get-together at the VP’s house had to be canceled “because Biden would grope all of our wives and girlfriend’s asses.”
 In fact, things were so bad that at one point a Secret Service agent almost got into a fight with Biden.
 Here is more from Paul Joseph Watson…
 During one alleged incident in 2009, Biden cupped the breast of a Secret Service agent’s girlfriend during a photo, prompting the agent to shove Biden and almost hit him.
 The agent was subsequently suspended for a week, according to the source.
 Men would often stand in front of female agents and Navy women or create false pretenses to have them leave the room just to get them away from Biden, according to the agent.
 When I am elected to Congress, I am going to make fighting this sort of predatory behavior a top priority.
 We are supposed to serve as an example to the rest of the world, and instead, we have become a bad joke.
 Those that have been engaging in this sort of shameful behavior have got to go because we simply are not going to put up with it anymore.

"Madagascar Outbreak: It Is ‘Inevitable’ The Plague Becomes Resistant To Drugs
 
 The newest warning about the outbreak of the airborne pneumonic plague, or black death, in Madagascar has been released.
 Officials warn that it’s inevitable that this bacterial infection that’s infected over 2000 people will become resistant to antibiotics.
 The only way to treat a person who has contracted the plague is with antibiotics.
 But experts now warn that because they are being used so much to treat the infection, antibiotics resistance is inevitable and making this disease much more terrifying.
 Once the bacteria is resistant, the Madagascar healthcare system will be overwhelmed, and the disease will have control of the nation.
 According to the Daily Mail, Madagascar’s healthcare system will be unable to cope if the deadly plague outbreak continues to escalate, a scientist has warned.
 Scores of doctors and nurses have been struck down with the disease, which is predicted to gather momentum in the coming weeks and there are growing fears hospitals will be unable to meet the illness’ burden.
 Official figures reveal at least 2,034 people have been infected with the “medieval disease” so far in what has been described as the “worst outbreak in 50 years.” The black death outbreak has so far claimed at least 165 lives.
 Although the plague is responding well to antibiotics right now, drug resistance is also an increasing concern amongst experts who predict it will vastly accelerate the disease’s death toll.
 Professor John Joe McFadden from the University of Surrey told MailOnline: “Fortunately in [the] plague, it has not developed much antibiotic resistance.
 If that kicks in, the plague will be far, far scarier.
 If you throw more and more antibiotics at patients, antibiotic resistance is more or less inevitable.”
 Dr. Derek Gatherer, from Lancaster University’s biomedical and life-sciences department, told MailOnline the country would struggle “to cope” if cases continue to spiral.
 “Madagascar, typically like many African countries, doesn’t have many doctors.
 There are around three-and-a-half thousand doctors for 22 million people.
 They only have around 6,000 hospital beds, so they aren’t particularly well positioned to cope with these kind of events.
 And if it wasn’t for the international aid coming in things would definitely be much worse for them.”
 And experts continue to fear the healthcare system is on the brink of being overwhelmed.
 Should the disease actually spread to the African mainland, it will be all but impossible to control and the health care system would certainly be unable to handle the outbreak at that point, making a global pandemic much more likely.

"Al Franken Is Just The Beginning As The Curtain Is Pulled Back In Washington DC
 
 Al Franken Is Just The Beginning As The Curtain Is Pulled Back In Washington DC
 Please help support us with cryptocurrency donations.
 Thank you!
 For decades, Americans have known that very sick things happen behind the scenes in Washington D.C., but the mainstream media nearly really talks about any of it.
 But now the curtain is starting to be pulled back, and the revelations about Al Franken are just the beginning.
 Earlier this week, I wrote an article about how “sexual harassment is rampant in the halls of Congress”, and that was before a female radio anchor named LeeAnn Tweeden revealed that Al Franken had “forcibly kissed” and groped her during a USO tour in 2006.
 The following comes from an article in which Tweeden shared her story…
 I couldn’t believe it.
 He groped me, without my consent, while I was asleep.
 I felt violated all over again.
 Embarrassed.
 Belittled.
 Humiliated.
 How dare anyone grab my breasts like this and think it’s funny?
 I told my husband everything that happened and showed him the picture.
 I wanted to shout my story to the world with a megaphone to anyone who would listen, but even as angry as I was, I was worried about the potential backlash and damage going public might have on my career as a broadcaster.
 But that was then, this is now.
 I’m no longer afraid.
 When the story initially broke, Franken rushed to issue an apology…
 “I certainly don’t remember the rehearsal for the skit in the same way, but I send my sincerest apologies to Leeann,” said Franken.
 “As to the photo, it was clearly intended to be funny but wasn’t.
 I shouldn’t have done it.”
 Needless to say, many were completely unsatisfied with Franken’s very weak statement.
 In fact, some members of his own party said that his apology was entirely insufficient and are calling for Franken to be held accountable for his actions…
 Guy Cecil, the former head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and now the boss of a leading Democratic super PAC, voiced his frustration with the inadequacy of Franken’s apology on Twitter.
 “That was not an apology and was an insufficient response to serious allegations,” Cecil tweeted.
 “Al Franken must be held accountable if our party wants to live up to our commitment to women & girls.”
 This scandal has set off a feeding frenzy as Internet sleuths search for other incidents in which Franken has acted inappropriately.
 And of course, since we are talking about Al Franken, it wasn’t exactly difficult to find material.
 For example, a photo has surfaced of Franken grabbing Joy Behar in a very creepy manner.
 The following comes from Breitbart…
 Amid the emergence of a 2006 photo of Al Franken groping journalist and talk radio anchor Leeann Tweeden, a photo of the embattled Minnesota Senator appearing to grab comedian Joy Behar’s breast has also resurfaced.
 Franken was a comedian before he ever entered the world of politics, and we understand that.
 But just because he was a comedian does not mean that he gets to play by a different set of rules.
 There appears to be an ongoing pattern of behavior, and Fox News has documented some of the other incidents that have come up in the past…
 Franken, then a comedian, was quoted in a 1995 New York Magazine article discussing a skit for “Saturday Night Live” that involved drugging and raping CBS reporter Lesley Stahl.
 Franken, at the time a writer for “SNL,” suggested one skit should play out with “60 Minutes” commentator Andy Rooney finding an empty pill bottle on his desk.
 “’I give the pills to Lesley Stahl.
 Then when Lesley is passed out, I take her to the closet and rape her.’ Or ‘That’s why you never see Lesley until February.’ Or, ‘When she passes out.
 I put her in various positions and take pictures of her,’” Franken was quoted saying.
 The article, along with a 2000 Playboy column in which Franken talked about fantasizing a machine would perform oral sex on him, was used to attack Franken during his 2008 Senate campaign in Minnesota.
 As much as we may be appalled by some of the things that Al Franken has done, the truth is that there are far worse offenders in Washington.
 Let’s talk about Bill Clinton for a moment.
 Democrats have been covering up his sexual crimes for years, and my hope is that now this will start to change.
 Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey, Connie Hamzy, Eileen Wellstone, Sandra Allen James, Christy Zercher, Paula Jones, Monica Lewinsky, Gennifer Flowers, Elizabeth Ward Gracen, Sally Perdue, Lencola Sullivan, Susie Whitacre and Bobbie Ann William are some of the women that have made allegations against Clinton, and if even half of their allegations are true Clinton should be in prison for the rest of his life.
 In my article yesterday, I discussed how one Secret Service agent is charging former Vice-President Joe Biden of engaging in “Weinstein-level” behavior, and I also talked about how 15 million dollars in settlements have been secretly paid out to victims of sexual harassment in the House of Representatives in recent years.
 There is a culture of corruption in Washington D.C., and we desperately need to drain the swamp.
 If you agree, I hope that you will support my campaign and the campaigns of other anti-establishment candidates that want to clean up the halls of Congress.
 It is time to take our government back because at this point it has become an absolutely disgusting cesspool of filth and corruption.

"Shock: Black Death Patients Are ESCAPING The Hospital Over Fear Of Needles As Officials Worry Plague Could Spread
 
 Patients in Madagascar who are currently suffering from the plague have “escaped” multiple hospitals in the area over fears of needles and hospital treatment as a whole, according to a shocking report in The Sun newspaper.
 Security guards with at least one hospital have been tasked with forcefully keeping black death patients in the hospital as well as following the strict safety procedures set up in an attempt to quell the outbreak.
 The Sun reported:
 Officials at the hospital say the main reason why patients run away is that they are scared of needles and don’t have much experience of hospitals.
 Jean Benoit Manhes, the deputy representative of Unicef, told the Irish Times: “Some escaped because they’re afraid of needles.
 People here are not used to the hospital.
 “The problem of plague is not just a medical response.
 You can have hospitals but if people don’t come it isn’t enough.” Such incidents have prompted fears that the plague could spread even further with each confirmed case requiring 20 people have been in contact with to be treated as a precaution.
 Malagasy people have also been told not to carry out their traditional burial tradition of Famidihana which involves digging up their dead relatives every seven years.
 It means ‘turning the bones’ and sees families cleaning the remains, rewrapping them and reburying them while other family members perform a special dance.
 The African island’s government has told citizens to pause the tradition for fear the plague bacteria is still active in the corpses and can be spread to the living.
 News of infected patients running away from hospitals comes on the heels of reports that it is only a matter of time before the plague becomes resistant to the antibiotics that are currently being used to treat the outbreak.
 Mac Slavo recently reported for SHTFplan:
 The newest warning about the outbreak of the airborne pneumonic plague, or black death, in Madagascar has been released.
 Officials warn that it’s inevitable that this bacterial infection that’s infected over 2000 people will become resistant to antibiotics.
 The only way to treat a person who has contracted the plague is with antibiotics.
 But experts now warn that because they are being used so much to treat the infection, antibiotics resistance is inevitable and making this disease much more terrifying.
 Once the bacteria is resistant, the Madagascar healthcare system will be overwhelmed, and the disease will have control of the nation.
 As Slavo noted, should the disease spread to the African mainland, one can assume that it will be all but impossible to control, thus increasing the likelihood of global pandemic.

"Black Death Warning: The Plague Is Impossible To Eradicate

 An expert is warning the plague that has sickened over 2000 people in Madagascar since August is impossible to eradicate.
 Even though the number of those infected has dropped in recent weeks, the plague will never truly be gone.
 Since the airborne version of the plague can kill a person in just three hours, experts warn that its too soon to think that since there hasn’t been a person infected in recent days, that it won’t pop up again.
 That’s because the bacteria that causes plague is now so widespread in wildlife, that humans can’t do anything to get rid of it, said Dr. Allen Cheng, Professor of Infectious Diseases Epidemiology at Monash University in Melbourne.
 “It’s not possible to eradicate plague, as it is widespread in wildlife rodents outside the sphere of human influence,” Cheng wrote on The Conversation.
 “Outbreaks, generally, are managed reactively by ‘firefighting teams’, deployed to clear houses of fleas, identify and treat cases and give pre-emptive treatment to contacts at risk.
 A more preventative approach, such as the identification of areas at risk using climate models and animal surveys to focus flea and rat control efforts, would be better,” he said.
 “But, this requires a better understanding of transmission pathways in each region where disease persists.”
 The best way to stop the plague spreading was to focus on flea and rat control in the most at-risk areas, he said.
 Cheng’s comments came after at least 171 people died in Madagascar over an outbreak of plague.
 Nine countries were urged by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to prepare for a black death attack, at the end of October.
 It’s been reported that plague has been transmitted to humans by camels, goats, prairie dogs, rock squirrels and guinea pigs since the 1960’s.
 There are only a few remaining hotspots for plague in the world – Madagascar being one of them.
 This outbreak was also highly “unusual”, in that several different parts of the island were affected, including areas with lots of people.
 WHO has reported 2119 cases of the plague as of November 10.
 171 have died of the disease so far.

"How Do You Like Paying For Sexual Harassment Settlements from Your Congress, America?
 
 How Do You Like Paying For Sexual Harassment Settlements from Your Congress, America?
 Please help support us with cryptocurrency donations.
 Thank you!
 We finally have the official numbers, and they aren’t pretty.
 Reid Wilson, a correspondent for the Hill, has posted to Twitter a year by year breakdown of sexual harassment settlements and awards that he received from the Congressional Office of Compliance.
 I went ahead and added up each column, and what I discovered is that 264 cases of sexual harassment in Congress have been settled since 1997, and the total amount awarded in those settlements comes to a grand total of $17,250,854.
 So where has the $17,250,854 come from to pay those settlements?
 That money has come from the taxpayers of course.
 That means that you and I have been paying to cover up the epidemic of sexual harassment that has been taking place on Capitol Hill.
 When U.S. Representative Jackie Speier originally told us that more than 15 million dollars had been paid out to victims of sexual harassment in recent years, I was envisioning a few dozen cases at most.
 I had no idea that the total number of cases would actually be well over 200.
 If our leaders were serious about stopping this from happening, they would pass a law making it mandatory that all cases of sexual harassment in Congress be made public, and that members of Congress would be personally responsible for paying out any settlements.
 If such a law was instituted, I guarantee you that sexual harassment on Capitol Hill would come to a screeching halt.
 But they don’t want it to stop.
 For many in Congress, having so many attractive young women around is one of the key benefits of the job.
 I included the following quote from CNN in an article the other day, but I also believe that it fits just perfectly here…
 In an environment with “so many young women,” said one ex-House aide, the men “have no self-control.” “Amongst ourselves, we know,” a former Senate staffer said of the lawmakers with the worst reputations.
 And sometimes, the sexual advances from members of Congress or senior aides are reciprocated in the hopes of advancing one’s career — what one political veteran bluntly referred to as a “sex trade on Capitol Hill.”
 Do you want to stop this from happening?
 It isn’t going to stop until we boot out the corrupt career politicians that are engaging in this type of behavior.
 So I am asking you to support my campaign and other “grassroots deplorables” that are running for office all over the nation.
 Morality really matters when it comes to serving in public office, and we are not going to send people that engage in sexually inappropriate behavior to Washington anymore.
 And I am calling on Congress to immediately release the details of all of the 264 cases of sexual harassment that have been settled since 1997.
 The American people have a right to know, and those that engaged in this type of behavior do not have a right to hide.
 It is time to drain the swamp, and this would be a really good place to start.

"America's Immigration Voice.
 
 Kritarch Patti Saris thinks she runs immigration policy, right down to how many times someone can have their case reviewed, though she seems confused as to who will do the reviewing of those cases.
 At issue is a large group of Indonesian Chinese Christians who fled a pogrom in Indonesia directed against them in the 1990s.
 The Chinese generally filed asylum applications after arriving in the United States, and, importantly, not at an American embassy or consulate in Indonesia or nearby.
 All were relatively wealthy and had or obtained tourist visas to the United States.
 This is important as most actual ""refugees"" drop everything to flee their homelands if they are under threat of death.
 Tellingly, these asylum applicants were the elite of Indonesian society, because their higher average IQ, than the rather dull Indonesians.
 87 is the average Indonesian IQ , and note that average includes the higher average Chinese, so the locals really are a dull lot.
 This is important in that while there was anti-Chinese and anti-Christian violence, the non-Chinese Christians mostly stuck around, though the Chinese used tourist and student visas to come to the United States in a leisurely manner, taking time to either bring or otherwise secure their wealth in Indonesia.
 In any event, the persecution was limited in time and duration as the local elite know they need the Chinese to run the economy and to avoid Red China intervening on behalf of their fellow ethnics.
 In the United States, these Chinese went through the liberal asylum process, but did not manage to fool even the credulous ""judges"" at the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), the immigration courts.
 Fast forward to the Obama Regime Administrative Amnesty , where despite outstanding deportation orders, these illegal aliens, among millions of others, are allowed to remain, and then given employment authorization as well.
 Fortunately, elections have consequences, and the Obama Regime Administrative Amnesty, or parts of it, came to an inglorious end.
 And end it was for this particular lot of illegal aliens.
 But Kritarch Patti Saris was having none of the immigration laws of the United States.
 She thought she was decider-in-chief on who gets deported.
 And all on the flimsy excuse that the aliens need another bite at the apple, despite the clear fact that the Indonesian government had long ago quashed the ethnic riots directed against the market dominant minority of Chinese and the religious motivated violence against Christians.
 While there are a couple of provinces in Indonesia that impose Sharia law on Muslims, most non-Muslims are exempt.
 As moderates go, Indonesia is about as close as it gets to moderate Muslims.
 Mostly because the country would not last long without an outside high IQ elite to run the country.
 Before it was the high IQ Dutch, now it's the Chinese.
 Remember, an 87 IQ is just about retarded.
 A federal judge on Monday ordered U.S. immigration officials to delay any efforts to deport 51 Indonesians living illegally in New Hampshire so the group can have time to argue that changing conditions in that country would make it dangerous to return... Federal law gives authority over immigration matters to the executive branch, not the courts.
 Chief U.S. District Judge Patti Saris in Boston found she had authority to ensure the Indonesians have a chance to argue that conditions in their home country had deteriorated significantly enough to reopen their cases for trying to stay in the United State.
 She worried that without the order, ICE officials could deport some of the Indonesians covered by the suit, at which time they would lose the opportunity to have their cases reopened.
 [Judge Orders U.S. To Delay Deporting Indonesians In Immigration Fight, by Scott Malone, Reuters, November 27, 2017]
 Kritarch Saris thought she knew better and has been running a deliberate campaign to prevent the deportation of these Chinese illegal aliens.
 And now she has gone full rogue, prohibiting the deportation of all these illegal aliens who already had their day in immigration court.Saris appears to be making up immigration law and procedure on the fly, as her order appears to not understand either the EOIR process or immigration law.
 “The government shall inform the court whether petitioners, who are not detained, will have access to emergency procedures if they must file their original motions to reopen,” Saris wrote.
 This makes no sense in English, much less in the established procedures in the EOIR.
 The aliens have no emergency, there are no emergency procedures, and their original motions to reopen were denied for lack of legal basis in law or any changed conditions in the country they are being deported to that would avail them of another claim.
 Indonesia is more hospitable to Chinese Christians today than the short period in the 90s when there was a problem.
 But basically, Saris wants the illegal aliens the opportunity to submit another asylum application, and benefit by the years it will take to adjudicate those claims.
 Basically Saris wants these illegals to never leave.
 That, of course is not her role.
 The only claim they have before a Federal court is if they got the due process that Congress gave those illegal aliens.
 And they did, they filed for asylum, had a hearing and appeals, and lost.
 With the legislative fight over DACA, the Trump Administration needs to include legislative language including more restrictions on kritarchs who want to make American immigration policy, as well as other reforms to lower legal immigration, build the wall, and deport illegals here.
 Or impeachment, or both.

"The US Is Blatantly Telling Lies
 
 It’s no secret that the Trump administration has a strong distaste for Iran.
 Iran is one of the only issues on which the U.S. president has remained relatively consistent.
 Trump berated the country both before and after taking office.
 However, Trump’s anti-Iran strategy goes against the better judgment of even the most anti-Iranian advisors in his staff who don’t want to see the U.S. isolated on the world stage.
 Fortunately for Trump, however, he is not alone in his bid to isolate and demonize Iran at all costs.
 On December 12, Trump’s ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley, gave a grandiose speech demonizing Iran that echoed Colin Powell’s infamous performance before the U.N. in 2003.
 Haley’s essential claim was that Saudi Arabia is under attack by missiles supplied to Yemen by the Iranian government and that the world should not sit idly by as this goes on.
 “If we do nothing about the missiles fired at Saudi Arabia, we will not be able to stop the violence,” Haley warned.
 “There is clear evidence that the missiles that landed on Saudi Arabia come from Iran,” she said.
 “The evidence is undeniable.
 The weapons might as well have had ‘Made in Iran’ stickers all over it.”
 Buy Gold at Discounted Prices
 However, even as Haley opened her mouth, many commentators could already identify a number of issues with her speech.
 As Common Dream’s Reza Marashi explained:
 “Haley cited a UN report in her claim regarding Iranian missile transfers to the Houthis.
 Of course, the UN has reached no such conclusion.
 Instead, a panel of experts concluded that fired missile fragments show components from an Iranian company, but they have ‘no evidence as to the identity of the broker or supplier.’ Asked about Haley’s claim that Iran is the culprit, Sweden’s ambassador to the UN said, ‘The info I have is less clear.’ Analysts from the U.S. Department of Defense speaking to reporters at Haley’s speech openly acknowledged that they do not know the missiles’ origin.
 Perhaps most surreal is the very same UN report cited by Haley also says the missile included a component that was manufactured by an American company.
 Did she disingenuously omit that inconvenient bit from her remarks, or fail to read the entire UN report?
 The world may never know.”
 Regardless of the fact that Haley misrepresented the U.N. report in question, it appears the entire premise of the U.N. report is almost completely incorrect, anyway, according to former inspector Scott Ritter.
 Ritter writes:
 “The missile debris in question actually contradicts the finding of the UN panel, which held that the missiles launched against Saudi Arabia had been transferred to Yemen in pieces and assembled there by Houthi missile engineers; it is clear that the missiles in question had been in the possession of Yemen well before the Saudi Arabian-led intervention of 2015, and that their source was either Soviet or North Korean.
 The modification kits, on the other hand, appear to be of Iranian origin, and were transported to Yemen via Oman.
 The UN panel claims not to have any evidence of ‘external missile specialists’ working alongside the Houthi; indeed, the simplicity of the Burkhan 2-H modification concept is such that anyone already familiar with the SCUD-B missile system would be able to implement the required processes without outside assistance.” [emphasis added]
 So where did the missiles come from, and who made them?
 According to Ritter:
 “Rather than the Iranian-manufactured Qiam-1 missiles Haley and the Saudi Arabian government claimed, the debris presented by Haley were of a modified Soviet-manufactured SCUD-B missile; the airframe and engine are original Soviet-made components, and many of the smaller parts on display bear Cyrillic (i.e., Russian) markings.
 The transformation to the Burkhan 2-H design required the Houthi engineers to increase the size of the fuel and oxidizer tanks, and lengthen the airframe accordingly.
 This is done by cutting the airframe, and welding in place the appropriate segments (this also required that the fuel supply pipe, which passes through the oxidizer tank, be similarly lengthened.)
 The difference in quality between the factory welds and the new welds is readily discernable.
 The increased fuel supply permits a longer engine burn, which in turn increases the range of the missile.
 The Burkhan 2-H uses a smaller warhead than the SCUD B; as such, the guidance and control section had been reconfigured to a smaller diameter, and an inter-stage section added to connect the warhead/guidance section with the main airframe.”
 ﻿
 Those who have been paying attention to this conflict have been well aware that the U.S. has had little material evidence to link Yemen’s Houthis to Iranian arms suppliers.
 In January of this year, a panel of U.N. experts stated:
 “The panel has not seen sufficient evidence to confirm any direct large-scale supply of arms from the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, although there are indicators that anti-tank guided weapons being supplied to the Houthi or Saleh forces are of Iranian manufacture.” [emphasis added]
 Even if Iran were arming the Houthis, Haley’s hypocritical anti-Iran rhetoric doesn’t excuse the U.S. for continuing a foreign policy that essentially armed ISIS through U.S. weapons transfers, or for arming al-Qaeda’s affiliate in Syria, just to name two examples of Washington’s schizophrenic approach to the region.
 Why is the U.S. singling out Iran, especially when the Houthi rebels are sworn enemies of al-Qaeda?
 The issues here go much deeper than nonsensical hypocrisy.
 According to Ritter, the entire debacle has shown that if Saudi Arabia cannot contain the Houthi’s missile capabilities, it cannot possibly hope to take on Iran, which possesses a significantly more advanced military than the Houthis do on their own.
 Ritter explains further:
 “If a relatively unsophisticated foe such as the Houthi, using Iranian-modified Soviet and North Korean missiles derived from 40-year-old technology, can evade an enemy force using the most modern combat aircraft backed up by the most sophisticated intelligence gathering systems available, and successfully launch ballistic missiles that threaten the political and economic infrastructure of the targeted state, what does that say about the prospects of any U.S.-led coalition taking on the far more advanced mobile missile threats that exist in North Korea and Iran today?
 The fact of the matter is that no military anywhere has shown the ability to successfully interdict in any meaningful way a determined opponent armed with mobile ballistic missile capability.
 If the Saudi experience in Yemen is to teach us anything, it is that any military plan designed to confront nations such as North Korea, Iran and Russia that are armed with sophisticated mobile ballistic missiles had better count on those capabilities remaining intact throughout any anticipated period of hostility.
 No amount of chest-thumping and empty rhetoric by American political and/or military leaders can offset this harsh reality.
 This is the critical lesson of Yemen, and the United States would do well to heed it before it tries to foment a crisis based upon trumped-up charges.” [emphasis added]

 Kritarch Patti Saris, who thinks it is the job of District Court judges to micromanage the deportation system of the United States, got her wish.
 One of the Indonesian illegal aliens benefiting from her little amnesty took the hint and used the opportunity that Saris created to flee from arrest and deportation, absconding to a sanctuary church to hide from arrest.
 Kritarch Patti Saris
 Saris like many other Federal judges does not like our current immigration system and wants another system more to her liking.
 One of those likings is an unlimited number of hearings as to previously denied asylum claims.
 Carrying his 3-year-old daughter in his arms, Yohanes Tasik scoped out the church classroom he indefinitely would call home.
 The Indonesian Christian, facing mounting pressure to report to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, took refuge Friday night inside the Reformed Church of Highland Park.
 He is the third Indonesian Christian who claimed sanctuary within the church in fear of deportation.
 [Indonesian Immigrant Finds Sanctuary In N.J. Church, by Steph Solis, USA Today, January 16, 2018]
 Saris should know that when the appeal of her decision that the Indonesian illegal aliens gets reviewed by the Supreme Court, her decision will be struck down.
 So she seem to have acted to encourage the illegal aliens in the case she is managing to see the writing on the wall, and use her order prohibiting their arrest and deportation to flee the authorities.Even the illegal aliens know that minor kritarchs have no authority over deportations, especially those that have been fully adjudicated and any claim of asylum found to be without any basis so they are taking up other options to fight deportation, like fleeing and hiding.
 A federal judge on Wednesday signaled she may extend an order preventing the deportation of roughly 50 Indonesian Christians living illegally in New Hampshire, a process that immigration officials began after U.S. President Donald Trump took office.
 U.S. District Judge Patti Saris in Boston expressed concern the Indonesians could be deported before their administrative appeals were finished, given their claims they could face religious persecution in the world’s largest majority-Muslim nation.
 [U.S. Judge May Extend Freeze On Indonesian Immigrants' Deportation, by Nate Raymond, Reuters, January 17, 2018]
 Federal officials contend they have always had the authority to deport them at any time.
 “There’s no legal basis for them to ask for more time,” Vinita Andrapalliyal, a U.S. Justice Department lawyer, argued in court on Wednesday.
 Federal law gives authority over immigration matters to the executive branch, not the courts.
 Over the Justice Department’s objections, Saris last year ruled she had jurisdiction over the case.
 She entered a temporary order blocking the Indonesians’ deportation until she could decide whether to impose a preliminary injunction.
 Ronaldo Rauseo-Ricupero, a lawyer for the Indonesians, argued they should have 90 days to move to reopen their cases after receiving copies of their administrative case files and time to appeal any decision rejecting those motions.
 “We don’t want to put them on a ship back unless someone has had chance to look at if there’s a really bad situation for them,” Saris said.
 “That’s my concern.”
 And Kritarch Saris has not stopped.
 She is moving forward with more orders to halt deportation of illegal aliens.Kritarch Saris just does not accept that the immigration courts found no basis for their claim of persecution, and there is no evidence that they would face persecution today.
 She and other kritarchs have acted outside the law, something that the reporter surprisingly puts in the story.And the Treason Bar attorney demanded that Kritarch Saris create a whole new second immigration appeals system of unlimited delay for these illegal aliens.Kritarch Saris thinks that her feelings about a deportation are the same as the law.Well, that is not Kritarch Saris' concern.
 The concern over persecution overseas is reviewed by the Executive Branch, and that decision was entered--there is no ""bad situation"" for her to be concerned about.
 And Saris is not the only kritarch that thinks they run immigration policy--Mark Goldsmith thinks he runs immigration policy as well.
 A federal judge in Michigan has ordered the government to give bond hearings in preparation for releasing hundreds of illegal immigrants from Iraq into the community, saying the Constitution protects them from indefinite detention in the U.S. U.S. District Judge Mark A Goldsmith, an Obama appointee, earlier had halted deportations for nearly 300 Iraqis, saying that although they had long been ordered removed, conditions on the ground in Iraq had changed and they deserved new hearings.
 His latest ruling Tuesday evening goes further, certifying some of the Iraqis as a class-action lawsuit and saying most of them should be “allowed to return to their productive lives” while they wait for new hearings — meaning they must be released from detention unless the government can prove they are a major risk to public safety.
 [Judge Orders Potential Release Of Hundreds Of Illegals From Iraq, by Stephen Dinan, Washington Times, January 3, 2018]
 He is ordering the release of hundreds of Iraqi illegal aliens and criminal aliens, all because he wants them to have another bite at the apple--they, like the Indonesians, lost claims to political asylum years ago.
 Kritarch Mark Goldsmith
 Both these kritarchs are part of illegal and unconstitutional #Resistance to the lawful immigration policies of President Trump.
 Illegal aliens get only one hearing and one set of appeals to deportation.
 They don't get another new and illegal set of hearings and appeals just because some minor kritarch wants something.
 Time for Congress to end this by prohibiting review of immigration and deportation decisions.

"Conspiracy: Muslim Photographer & Nation Of Islam Hid Photos Of Obama With Farrakhan Since 2008
 
 The left-wing enemedia worked as furiously to cover up, censor and sanction Barack Hussein Obama’s jihad and violent left-wing connections as they do to manufacture and make up lies to destroy President Trump.
 The LA Times refused to release a video of the infamous Jew-hating event Obama hosted with close confidante and infamous antisemite Rashid Khalidi.
 The media gave scant coverage to Obama’s close relationship with radical Reverend Jeremiah “God damn America) Wright who blamed the US for 9/11.
 I detailed Obama’s nefarious connections and resulting worldview in my book, The Post-American Presidency: The Obama Administration’s War on America , which was ignored by the mainstream media.
 The Muslim photographer Askia Muhammad, who took this photo of candidate Barack Obama and vicious jihad-supporting racist Louis Farrakhan, knew this would impact the election: he said so.
 And so he conspired with the terror group, the Nation of Islam, to keep it hidden for 10 years.
 He has served as the editor of Muhammad Speaks and as the head of the Washington office of The Final Call, the official newspapers of the Nation of Islam.
 [4][5] He has worked as a commentator for National Public Radio and a columnist for Washington Informer.
 [6][7] (Wikipedia)
 The photographer, Askia Muhammad, told the Trice Edney News Wire that he “gave the picture up at the time and basically swore secrecy.”“But after the nomination was secured and all the way up until the inauguration; then for eight years after he was President, it was kept under cover,” Muhammad said.
 Asked whether he thought the photo’s release would have affected Obama’s presidential campaign, Muhammad said, “I insist.
 It absolutely would have made a difference.”
 Farrakhan In His Own Words (PDF).
 Some Farrakhan quotes:
 “The Jews don’t like Farrakhan, so they call me Hitler.
 Well, that’s a good name.
 Hitler was a very great man.”
 “My god will wipe this country (America) from the face of the earth.”
 On on the Jewish people: “You are wicked deceivers of the American people.
 You have sucked their blood.”
 “The Jews don’t like Farrakhan, so they call me Hitler.
 Well, that’s a good name.
 Hitler was a very great man.”
 “You are not now, nor have you ever been a citizen of America.
 You are a slave to white America.”
 “America is in trouble, and I say God is about to wipe this nation from the face of the Earth.
 I’m not crazy, I’m not drunk, how long do you think a nation can do evil and not face the wrath of god?”
 “You see everybody always talk about Hitler exterminating six million Jews.
 That’s right.
 But don’t nobody ever ask what did they do to Hitler.”
 White people are potential humans – they haven’t evolved yet.
 On Hezbollah: “They call them terrorists, I call them freedom fighters.”
 “The Mother Wheel is a heavily armed spaceship the size of a city, which will rain destruction upon white America but save those who embrace the Nation of Islam.”
 THE PHOTO THAT NEVER SAW THE LIGHT OF DAY: OBAMA WITH FARRAKHAN IN 2005 By Esme Cribb | Talking Point Memo January 25, 2018 2:16 pm
 Askia Muhammad A journalist announced last week that he will publish a photograph of then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama (D) and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan that he took in 2005 at a Congressional Black Caucus meeting, but did not make public because he believed it would have “made a difference” to Obama’s political future.
 The photographer, Askia Muhammad, told the Trice Edney News Wire that he “gave the picture up at the time and basically swore secrecy.” “But after the nomination was secured and all the way up until the inauguration; then for eight years after he was President, it was kept under cover,” Muhammad said.

 TPM has published the photo above with Muhammad’s permission.
 “I sort of understood what was going on,” Muhammad told TPM.
 “I promised and made arrangements to give the picture to Leonard Farrakhan,” the minister’s son-in-law and chief of staff.
 Muhammad said he gave away “the disk” from his camera but “copied the photograph from that day onto a file” on his computer.
 “Realizing that I had given it up, I mean, it was sort of like a promise to keep the photograph secret,” Muhammad said.

 “Realizing that I had given it up, I mean, it was sort of like a promise to keep the photograph secret,” Muhammad said.
 Muhammad said he did not release his copy of the photograph because he thought it would be perceived as a betrayal of that promise: “I was really, I guess, afraid of them.”
 Malcolm X wasn’t adequately afraid of them.
 Here’s what happened to him:
 https://youtu.be/qSm1t3Uv9QI
 Muhammad said he thought the photograph would be “damaging politically” if it were released and was afraid that someone might “break into his apartment” looking for it, like “that Watergate crap.” He said he “felt a little bit more at ease” after Farrakhan in 2016 claimed that Obama visited his home in Chicago.
 Muhammad contacted Farrakhan in autumn 2017 with the “final manuscript” for a self-published book containing the photo.
 “I sent him a copy of the manuscript suggesting that, showing him the picture, and saying to him, if he did not object, I was going to publish it,” Muhammad said.
 “He had no objection.” … During Obama’s presidential campaign, conservatives pushed multiple apparently racially motivated conspiracy theories about Obama’s religion and supposed ties to Islam.
 For example, in Obama’s memoir subtitled A Story of Race and Inheritance, Obama recounts his being a regular reader of Minister Farrakhan’s Nation of Islam newspaper The Final Call.
 Obama recollects Farrakhan’s black nationalist capitalist campaign to get black people to use toothpaste manufactured by black-owned businesses.
 Farrakhan’s eventual failure suggests to Obama that’s there is more economic upside for blacks in shaking down white institutions than in building their own.
 During the 2008 presidential election, conservatives questioned the indirect ties between Farrakhan and Obama, who attended a church that gave Farrakhan an award.
 Obama’s “spiritual advisor” Rev.
 Jeremiah Wright gave Farrakhan his church’s Lifetime Achievement award in a downtown Chicago Hyatt Regency in November 2007, but the story didn’t make the press until the following year.
 Similarly, very little media attention was paid to the close relationship between Obama’s fundraiser and private mentor Tony Rezko and the Nation of Islam, even though Rezko’s role was business manager for Nation of Islam assets, such as the career of Muhammad Ali.
 But after all, what could be more boring than a story than involves a Presidential candidate, the Syrian Christian crook who helped him buy his house, the Nation of Islam, and the most famous boxer of all time?
 Reading Obama’s 1995 memoir, you might almost get the impression that after a prudent first term, during his second he might side with, I dunno, Black Lives Matter and encourage a wave of black rage and police retreat that drove up the death toll from murder by 20% in his last two years in office, an incremental death toll a little bigger than the U.S. combat death toll from the equally stupid Iraq War.

"Trump Effect: Islamic Republic Ceases Naval Provocations in Arabian Gulf
 
 Yesterday’s State of the Union address issued by Donald Trump represented a refreshing break from the eight years of pusillanimous foreign policies pursued by past administration.
 Nowhere was this more evident than in the manner in which Trump described Iran’s repressive regime and attempts by the Iranian people to overthrow it through peaceful protest.
 When it comes to Iran’s governing authorities, the Trump administration is under no illusions about the nefarious nature of this fascist theocracy.
 “We are restoring clarity about our adversaries,” Trump stated in a not too subtle jibe at his predecessor who seemed to be in a perpetual state of confusion about who his friends and enemies were.
 Trump also referenced the recent widespread Iranian protests, crushed with extreme ruthlessness by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and its Basij auxiliary militia.
 “When the people of Iran rose up against the crimes of a corrupt dictatorship,” he stated, “I did not stay silent.
 America stands with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom.”
 By contrast, Barack Obama and his obsequious acolytes were besotted by the prospect of forging détente with the despotic mullahs of the Islamic Republic.
 His administration remained largely silent when Iranians took to the streets in 2009 to protest a rigged election.
 Some have speculated that his administration missed out on a prime opportunity for regime change.
 It was only downhill from there.
 In a misguided effort to secure Iran’s willingness to sign the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, Obama sold everything including the kitchen sink.
 He tried selling the American people on the naïve notion that there were moderate elements of import in the Iranian government, ignoring the obvious fact that all authority in Iran is vested with the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, and his IRGC henchmen.
 The tried and true concept of peace through strength gave way to fecklessness through appeasement.
 Ransom payments to the tune of $1.7 billion were transferred to Iran.
 Promising criminal investigations targeting Iran’s chief terror proxy, Hezbollah, were shut down.
 Targeted liquidation operations by our Israeli allies against Iranian Quds Force leaders were foiled after Obama tipped off Tehran on Israel’s intentions.
 Iranian material breaches of the JCPOA were all but ignored while Iran’s ballistic missile program was allowed to proceed at full speed despite being in defiance of United Nations Security Council resolution 2231.
 Obama’s near messianic zealotry in his interactions with the mullahs severely compromised America’s national security and weakened its image on the international stage.
 Worse, it emboldened the mullahs (appeasement tends to do that) who seemed to revel in Obama’s groveling.
 Iran’s mischief-making extends far and wide but it is in the Arabian Gulf where friction between the IRGC and the United States Navy remains constant.
 Iran regards the Arabian Gulf as its domain and but for the presence of the U.S. 5th Fleet, would have full reign over its waters, which include the strategic Strait of Hormuz.
 In addition to securing the Gulf, the 5th Fleet serves as a constant reminder to the Iranians of their impotence.
 But the deterrent effect of the Navy’s 5th Fleet, and for that matter America’s military might, is only as effective as the political leadership that commands it, and Barack Obama as Commander in Chief of the armed forces did little to instill fear or project deterrence.
 On the contrary, the Iranians correctly viewed him as weak, indecisive and ineffectual.
 On his watch, American warships patrolling the Gulf were harried by armed IRGC speed boats and larger navy frigates with near impunity.
 At times Iranian naval vessels closed to within 600 to 150 yards of American warships.
 The navy termed these near ritualistic, belligerent encounters, “unsafe and unprofessional.”
 Iranian arrogance and impudence reached its zenith with the January 12th 2016 seizure of two American riverine command boats and their crews near Farsi Island.
 The RCBs and crews manning them were returned some 16 hours later but not before the Iranians stole two satellite phone sim cards, likely containing classified information, as well as thousands of pages of information downloaded from laptops, GPS devices and maps used by the sailors.
 Ironically, the seizure occurred on the very day that Obama was to give his State of the Union address but predictably, he didn’t think that the seizure of Americans was important enough to note.
 But according to the Navy, the past five months have witnessed markedly less belligerent conduct from the Iranians, leaving Navy officials baffled by the sudden positive change in attitude.
 In fact, Iran’s attitude adjustment in the Arabian Gulf is no mystery and stems from the Trump administration’s implementation of a new robust foreign policy vis-à-vis the Islamic Republic.
 Soon after taking office, Trump noted that “Iran [was] playing with fire” and added that he wouldn’t be as “kind” to the mullahs as Obama was.
 This wasn’t empty rhetoric.
 It was backed up by tangible action.
 Additional sanctions were imposed against Iran for acting in defiance of UNSCR 2231.
 Sanctions were also imposed against the IRGC for supporting terrorism.
 Trump’s DOJ revived and breathed new life into Project Cassandra, a promising anti-Hezbollah/IRGC law enforcement initiative shelved by Obama.
 Most importantly, Trump failed to certify the JCPOA noting material Iranian breaches, and has threatened to abrogate the deal in its entirety unless modifications are implemented.
 Those modifications would include an end to absurd sunset clauses in the JCPOA and tough restrictions on ballistic missile testing.
 The mullahs have become cognizant of the fact that there’s a new sheriff in town, one that backs up tough talk with action and doesn’t ask “how high” when they say “jump.” Clearly, the IRGC’s new docile posture in the Arabian Gulf is a direct consequence of this realization.

 I can't think of anything less irrelevant than a black gunman shooting two white cops--after five years of the ""Blacks Lives Matter"" movement.

"Police had previously gone to Ohio home where officers were killed
 
 Police in Ohio had previously gone to the home where a man fatally shot two police officers for three domestic disputes but no arrests were ever made, incident reports from the Columbus suburb of Westerville show.
 Westerville officers Eric Joering, 39, and Anthony Morelli, 54, were killed shortly after noon Saturday in this normally quiet suburb while responding to a 911 hang-up call.
 The suspect, 30-year-old Quentin Smith, was shot and wounded by the officers and taken to Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in critical condition Saturday, a Westerville city spokeswoman said.
 The hospital would not provide updates on his condition Sunday.
 A series of 911 calls released by the city of Westerville provide some details about what happened Saturday at a complex of townhomes.
 Smith lived there with his wife, Candace, and a young daughter.
 Westerville police have provided few details about what happened inside the townhome.
 Westerville Police Chief Joe Morbitzer said at a news conference Saturday that Joering, a 16-year veteran, and Morelli, a 30-year-veteran, were shot immediately upon entering the residence.
 Columbus police are investigating the shootings.
 After the initial hang-up call at noon, a dispatcher called the number back and reached a woman who was crying and can be heard saying, ""won't let me in.""
 Officers are then sent to the home.
 At 12:12 p.m., an officer tells a dispatcher that it's ""all quiet right now,"" followed by a door knock.
 At 12:13 p.m., after a dispatcher confirms contact has been made, a man's voice can be yelling, ""We have shots fired.""
 City of Westerville Police officers Anthony Morelli, 54, and Eric Joering, 39, were fatally shot while responding to a 911 call on Feb. 10, 2018 in Westerville, Ohio.

 Four minutes later, someone, presumably a police officer, tells a dispatcher: ""We have two officers down.
 Child on couch, one at gunpoint.""
 It's unclear at what point Smith was shot.
 Other 911 calls show that Candace Smith was hiding in bushes in front of the home, pleading for help because her daughter is still inside the home while a dispatcher calmly tells her to stay there.
 ""Please help,"" Candace Smith repeats several times in a call at 12:14 p.m. ""He shot the police officers.""
 Westerville police had gone to the couple's townhome for domestic disputes three times since September of last year.
 Joering and Morelli's names aren't listed on those calls.
 On Sept. 14, police responded to a call from Candace Smith that her husband was drunk and doing something to her car.
 A brief narrative from the officers says, ""No dispute or argument.""
 Candace Smith told officers they were separating, and that he left when she told him she was calling police.
 ""Female has his key so she is not concerned about him coming back,"" the report said.
 A Nov. 29 report said Candace Smith went to the Westerville police station asking about a protection order.
 She told officers that Quentin Smith had come home drunk earlier in the week and had ""forced himself on her,"" the report said.
 Candace Smith said she had found out that day she had been infected with a sexually transmitted disease, according to the report.
 Candace Smith also told officers that her husband had threatened to kill her, their daughter and himself if she left him.
 She said Smith always carried a gun despite being a convicted felon.
 Smith was convicted in Cuyahoga County, which includes Cleveland, of felony burglary and misdemeanor domestic violence charges in 2009 and was sentenced to four years in prison.
 Shortly after Candace Smith spoke with police at the Westerville station that day, police went to the home when Quentin Smith called to complain that his wife had locked him out of the house.
 They were told to stay in separate areas of the home.
 On Jan. 20, officers went to the home after Quentin Smith's mother called police to say the couple was arguing.
 They told police there weren't fighting

"Ohio Cop Killing Suspect’s Wife Hid in Bushes While Husband Shot Officers, 911 Call Shows
 
 The wife of the Ohio man suspected of killing two police officers on Saturday hid in the bushes as she called 911 to report that her husband had shot the cops, according to an audio recording of the call.
 Westerville Police Department officers Eric Joering, 39, and Anthony Morelli, 54, were allegedly shot dead by Quentin Smith after responding to a 911 hangup call.
 The call, which prompted officers to respond to the scene, came in just around noon on Saturday.
 In it, a woman can be heard crying before the line goes dead, the Cincinnati Enquirer reported.
 After dispatchers' attempts to return the call sent them to voicemail, Joering and Morelli went to the house, which had a history of domestic violence calls, according to the Columbus Dispatch.

 In the following call, the woman pleads for help.
 “Please help, please help,” she asks the dispatcher.
 “My husband shot the police officers,” the woman adds, telling the dispatcher she is hiding in the bushes while her one-year-old daughter is inside.
 She reported Smith shot one of the officers as he came into the house.

 “I don’t hear my daughter crying anymore,” the woman says.
 Officers later said they found her daughter on the couch and held Smith at gunpoint.
 Police have not released many details about the way the events transpired, but did say that Smith had injuries and was transported from the home.
 Authorities had responded to the house as recently as three weeks ago for a reported disturbance, records obtained by the Enquirer showed.
 At the time, the home's residents told police that there was nothing amiss.
 Smith’s wife had told police in November that her husband illegally carried a “gun all of the time,” according to the Enquirer.
 Smith was convicted of burglary in 2008, barring him for possessing a firearm.
 Authorities have not released which type of gun was used in the shooting.

 Earlier, I blogged that the police had released the name of the suspect in the murder of two white Westerville, OH cops (Quentin Lamar Smith) but no picture had appeared.
 I found the picture at right on a Mugshots site, attributed to a guy with the same name, in the same town.
 ( Most people named Quentin Lamar Smith are black, by the way.)
 Police charge suspect in death of two Westerville Police officers Quentin Lamar Smith was charged with two counts of aggravated murder on Sunday By WCMH Staff and The Associated Press Published: February 11, 2018, 4:45 pm Updated: February 11, 2018, 6:02 pm WESTERVILLE, OH (WCMH/AP) — The Westerville Division of Police has identified the suspect in the shooting death of two police officers as 30-year-old Quentin Lamar Smith.
 Westerville Police Chief Joe Morbitzer said officer Eric Joering, 39, died at the scene and his colleague, Anthony Morelli, 54, died at a local hospital.
 Smith was charged with two counts of aggravated murder on Sunday.
 Morbitzer said the officers were responding to a “potential domestic situation.” A neighbor who heard the gunfire said it happened at a home where the occupants were “always arguing and fighting.” “The officers gave their lives in defense of others,” Morbitzer said during a news conference, struggling to keep his emotions in check.
 He called them “true American heroes.” The Columbus Police Department is investigating the shootings.
 Police released incident reports showing officers had been to Smith’s home or had dealings with him several times since 2017, some for alleged domestic violence involving a woman identified in the reports as his wife, Candace Smith.
 Authorities said he was wounded and was treated at a hospital.
 In a Nov. 29 incident, Candace Smith, 33, went to a police station and asked about protection orders because she said she and her husband weren’t getting along and she discovered she had a sexually transmitted disease.
 She also told police that when she “threatens to leave Quentin, he tells her that he would kill her, their daughter, and himself,” the report said.
 Candace Smith told police her husband “has a gun that he carries all of the time, and if it isn’t on him, it is close by.” Police were called to the home later that night to investigate a report of domestic violence.

"Man arrested for allegedly buying gun used in killing of Ohio officers at scene of 911 hang-up call
 
 A second man has been arrested in the slaying of two Ohio police officers for allegedly buying the gun using in the killing, federal authorities said.
 Gerald Lawson III, 30, is accused of acting as a straw purchaser for the suspect, 30-year-old Quentin Lamar Smith, who is a convicted felon and not permitted to buy a firearm, the Justice Department for the Southern District of Ohio said.
 The Saturday shooting took place when Westerville police officers Eric Joering and Anthony Morelli responded to a 911 hang-up Saturday and were ""immediately met with gunfire"" and exchanged fire with Smith, police said.

 Smith, who allegedly had a Glock semi-automatic handgun, was also injured in the shooting and is in the hospital, authorities said.
 He is expected to survive, police said.
 The Columbus Division of Police, which is leading the investigation, has filed two counts of aggravated murder charges, according to the city of Westerville.
 He has not yet entered a plea.
 Lawson and Smith ""have a long history of friendship,"" according to the Justice Department.
 The Justice Department said a witness told investigators Smith gave Lawson money for the firearm and an extra $100 as compensation.
 Lawson was arrested today and charged with aiding and abetting the possession of a firearm by a prohibited person, the Justice Department said.
 He is scheduled to appear before a judge this afternoon.

 Morelli was married with two children and Joering was married with four daughters, according to The New York Times.
 Morelli's and Joering's families released a statement saying how ""thankful"" they are for the Westerville community.
 ""We feel loved and blessed, and we are appreciative of the outpouring of support,"" the statement read.
 ""We have seen and heard so much from people who have shared stories about how our men impacted their lives.
 They will be so greatly missed, not only by us, but by everyone they touched.""
 The statement described the fallen officers as ""dedicated,"" both to their jobs and as their roles as fathers and husbands.
 ""We are so sad that Eric will not see his three daughters graduate from high school.
 We’re devastated Tony will not be able to walk his daughter down the aisle at her wedding,"" the statement read.

 VDARE.com was the first news organization to make his race known, even though he was well known to law enforcement.
 It took about 10 hours for law enforcement to release his name.

 I have been unable to determine the race of Quentin’s wife--the domestic violence victim.
 The fact that there was a wedding makes me think she’s white.
 Also, she kind of sounds white in the 911 calls, but it’s hard to tell.

"Humanity’s WIPEOUT Foreshadowed?
 World Health Chief: Global Pandemic Imminent
 
 According to a World Health Organization doctor, a global pandemic is imminent, and no one will be prepared for it when it hits.
 Dr. Tedros Adhanom, director-general for WHO, has said that the next outbreak that will hit us will be a “terrible” one, causing a large death all over the world.
 “Humanity is more vulnerable in the face of epidemics because we are much more connected and we travel around much more quickly than before,” said WHO specialist in infectious diseases Dr. Sylvie Brand.
 “We know that it is coming, but we have no way of stopping it,” said Brand.
 According to Dr. Tedros, the flu is extremely dangerous to everyone living on the planet.
 This fear was also promoted by experts at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland last month.
 The claims came exactly 100 years after the 1918 Spanish flu that claimed 50 million lives and killed three times as many people as World War I.
 A mutated strain is the most likely contender to wipe out millions because it can join together with other strains to become deadlier.
 “This is not some future nightmare scenario.
 A devastating epidemic could start in any country at any time and kill millions of people because we are still not prepared.
 The world remains vulnerable.
 We do not know where and when the next global pandemic will occur, but we know it will take a terrible toll both on human life and on the economy,” said Dr. Tedros.
 “Hidden underneath this fear-mongering message of a global pandemic is a far more sinister W.H.O.
 agenda,” warns Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, publisher of Medicine.news.
 “The real agenda is a global push for blind, fear-based acceptance of unsafe, unproven vaccines that will be rolled out alongside the next global pandemic,” Adams warns.
 “Fear circumvents rational thinking, which is why the vaccine-pharma cartels routinely turn to irrational fear propaganda to demand absolute and unquestioning acceptance of risky medical interventions that should always be scrutinized for safety and efficacy.” –Natural News
 Dr. Tedros’ comments come on the heels of the plague outbreak in Madagascar, which was the most recent epidemic to receive international aid attention amid fears it would spread.
 More than 200 people were killed during the outbreak that ravaged the island over the winter, which prompted 10 nearby African countries to be placed on high alert.

"Trump fires Tillerson, replaces with former top spook
 
 Following what has appeared for months to be a strained relationship between President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the top diplomat is being replaced.
 Trump announced Tillerson’s ouster via Twitter Tuesday, saying: “Mike Pompeo, Director of the CIA, will become our new Secretary of State.
 He will do a fantastic job!
 Thank you to Rex Tillerson for his service!
 Gina Haspel will become the new Director of the CIA, and the first woman so chosen.
 Congratulations to all!”
 This is yet another big shake-up for Trump’s still-young administration — and it may be the most important one to date.
 The move creates some big questions about both the administration’s foreign policy ambitions as well as the president’s relationship with the deep state.
 If you enjoyed Hillary Clinton’s tenure as Secretary of State, you’ll like Pompeo’s.
 Like Clinton and her Democrat allies, Pompeo has long subscribed to the belief that Russia is perpetually meddling in U.S. affairs.
 In fact, he believes Barack Obama got Russian help too.
 While he was being confirmed as CIA chief, the former lawmaker lashed out at Russia for reasserting ” itself aggressively, invading and occupying Ukraine, threatening Europe, and doing nearly nothing to aid in the destruction and defeat of ISIS.”
 Again, if you liked Obama-era, world-on-fire, Russians everywhere State Department shenanigans, this is your guy.
 Pompeo also isn’t a huge fan of calling the federal government out when it is clearly violating the rights of Americans, as shown by his statements last year regarding WikiLeaks.
 “It is time to call out WikiLeaks for what it really is – a non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia.
 In January of this year, our Intelligence Community determined that Russian military intelligence — the GRU — had used WikiLeaks to release data of U.S. victims that the GRU had obtained through cyber operations against the Democratic National Committee.
 And the report also found that Russia’s primary propaganda outlet, RT, has actively collaborated with WikiLeaks,” he said.
 Pompeo favors increased U.S. involvement in Syria (hello, Russian proxy war), ratcheting pressure on Iran and regime change in North Korea.
 Clinton City…
 Moving on to Haspel, who will now be heading the CIA, nothing’s looking any brighter.
 She’s a big fan of torture, according to a 2013 Washington Post article pointed out this morning by The Intercept:
 IN MAY 2013, the Washington Post’s Greg Miller reported that the head of the CIA’s clandestine service was being shifted out of that position as a result of “a management shake-up” by then-Director John Brennan.
 As Miller documented, this official — whom the paper did not name because she was a covert agent at the time — was centrally involved in the worst abuses of the CIA’s Bush-era torture regime.
 As Miller put it, she was “directly involved in its controversial interrogation program” and had an “extensive role” in torturing detainees.
 Even more troubling, she “had run a secret prison in Thailand” — part of the CIA’s network of “black sites” — “where two detainees were subjected to waterboarding and other harsh techniques.” The Senate Intelligence Committee’s report on torture also detailed the central role she played in the particularly gruesome torture of detainee Abu Zubaydah.
 Beyond all that, she played a vital role in the destruction of interrogation videotapes that showed the torture of detainees both at the black site she ran and other secret agency locations.
 The concealment of those interrogation tapes, which violated multiple court orders as well as the demands of the 9/11 commission and the advice of White House lawyers, was condemned as “obstruction” by commission chairs Lee Hamilton and Thomas Keane.
 A special prosecutor and grand jury investigated those actions but ultimately chose not to prosecute.
 Bottom line, George W. Bush/Barack Obama era foreign policy and intelligence doctrines aren’t going anywhere under Trump.

"Yikes!
 Even John McCain is worried about Trump’s CIA pick
 
 Personal Liberty Poll Exercise your right to vote.
 After President Donald Trump nominated Gina Haspel to head the Central Intelligence Agency Tuesday, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said Americans need answers about her past involvement in state sponsored torture programs.
 As I noted earlier today, Haspel’s long career at the CIA spanned the years of torture carried out under the George W. Bush White House.
 A 2013 Washington Post report on the new CIA head called her role in the torture programs of that era “extensive” and noted that at one point she ran a CIA “black site” in Thailand where torture occurred.
 In a lengthy statement following Haspel’s nomination, McCain expressed big concerns about what it means for the agency’s future, saying:
 During his own confirmation proceedings for Director of the CIA, Mike Pompeo repeatedly committed that he would comply with the law that applies the Army Field Manual’s interrogation requirements to all U.S. agencies, including the CIA.
 The American people now deserve the same assurances from Gina Haspel, whose career with the agency has intersected with the program of so-called ‘enhanced interrogation techniques’ on a number of occasions.
 The torture of detainees in U.S. custody during the last decade was one of the darkest chapters in American history.
 Ms. Haspel needs to explain the nature and extent of her involvement in the CIA’s interrogation program during the confirmation process.
 I know the Senate will do its job in examining Ms. Haspel’s record as well as her beliefs about torture and her approach to current law.
 In the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, our government squandered precious moral authority in a futile effort to produce intelligence by means of torture.
 We are still dealing with the consequences of that desperately misguided decision.
 Current U.S. law is clear in banning enhanced interrogation techniques.
 Any nominee for Director of the CIA must pledge without reservation to uphold this prohibition, which has helped us to regain our position of leadership in the struggle for universal human rights—the struggle upon which this country was founded, and which remains its highest aspiration.
 Americans who value the Constitution should take this rare moment to agree with McCain.

 The Washington Post first reported on the story prior to Trump’s tweet.
 Trump and Tillerson have had a fraught relationship for many months.
 Trump told reporters Tuesday that he ultimately decided to fire the secretary because they disagreed over strategy in key areas of foreign policy, such as the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, the approach to North Korea and the overall tone of U.S. diplomacy.
 Tillerson said he received a call from Trump around noon Tuesday, more than three hours after his firing was first reported by The Washington Post and announced minutes later in a tweet from the president.
 His voice quivering, Tillerson thanked career diplomats for their “honesty and integrity” and the American people for “acts of kindness,” and he singled out Defense Secretary Jim Mattis for their partnership and mutual support of diplomacy.
 But he notably did not thank Trump or praise his policies.
 Tillerson said he will remain in his post until March 31 but is delegating all authorities for running the State Department to Deputy Secretary John Sullivan and is committed to ensuring “an orderly and smooth transition.” The deposed diplomat also made a clear statement about Russian aggression: “Much work remains to respond to the troubling behavior and actions on the part of the Russian government.”
 ﻿
 CNBC reports that Tillerson was not the only firing that took place on Tuesday:
 On Tuesday morning, State Department spokesman Steve Goldstein said Tillerson had no plans to leave.
 He “did not speak to the president this morning and is unaware of the reason” for his firing, the spokesman added.
 Two White House officials told the Associated Press that Tillerson found out he was fired Friday.
 The secretary got a call from White House chief of staff John Kelly but only got told an unspecified presidential tweet concerning him may be coming, officials at the State Department told the wire service.
 Later, the White House fired Goldstein, who contradicted the administration’s account of Tillerson’s ouster, according to NBC News and the AP.
 Goldstein was the under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs.
 Trump later told reporters he disagreed with Tillerson on some issues and feels the diplomat “will be much happier now.”
 While many are happy that Tillerson is gone, many of us are concerned with Mike Pompeo being installed at Secretary of State, especially regarding his un-American comments against NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, who exposed the criminal activity of the Deep State in DC.
 Speaking of Snowden, he decided to chime in on the newly appointed CIA director, but did not say anything about Pompeo becoming Secretary of State.
 “The new CIA director was a key part of the torture program and its illegal cover-up.
 Her name was on the Top Secret order demanding the destruction of tapes to prevent them being seen by Congress.
 Incredible.” Snowden tweeted.

 “Interesting: The new CIA Director Haspel, who ‘tortured some folks,’ probably can’t travel to the EU to meet other spy chiefs without facing arrest due to an @ECCHRBerlin complaint to Germany’s federal prosecutor,” tweeted Snowden.

 Glenn Greenwald, author of the above piece at The Intercept wrote, “Haspel, who will be the first woman to lead CIA, didn’t just oversee the Bush CIA’s black site but directly participated in the horrific torture of detainees.
 She also participated in the particularly gruesome torture of detainee Abu Zubaydah.”
 “This isn’t a radical departure for CIA,” Greenwald added.
 “After all, Haspel did this under George Tenet.
 At the time, John Brennan – who became Obama’s CIA director – was an advocate of rendition & other torture methods.
 And Pompeo was fine with black sites.
 Still notable: she’s an actual torturer.”
 From Greenwald’s article:
 This is more of the same old, same old going on, and it looks like it’s about to get a lot worse.

"Gina Haspel, New CIA Director
 
 President Donald Trump nominated Gina Haspel as the new director of the CIA, announcing the news on Twitter.
 Mike Pompeo, the previous director, was nominated to run the State Department to replace the ousted Rex Tillerson.
 * * * * *
 IN MAY 2013, the Washington Post’s Greg Miller reported that the head of the CIA’s clandestine service was being shifted out of that position as a result of “a management shake-up” by then-Director John Brennan.
 As Miller documented, this official — whom the paper did not name because she was a covert agent at the time — was centrally involved in the worst abuses of the CIA’s Bush-era torture regime.
 As Miller put it, she was “directly involved in its controversial interrogation program” and had an “extensive role” in torturing detainees.
 Even more troubling, she “had run a secret prison in Thailand” — part of the CIA’s network of “black sites” — “where two detainees were subjected to waterboarding and other harsh techniques.” The Senate Intelligence Committee’s report on torture also detailed the central role she played in the particularly gruesome torture of detainee Abu Zubaydah.
 Beyond all that, she played a vital role in the destruction of interrogation videotapes that showed the torture of detainees both at the black site she ran and other secret agency locations.
 The concealment of those interrogation tapes, which violated multiple court orders as well as the demands of the 9/11 commission and the advice of White House lawyers, was condemned as “obstruction” by commission chairs Lee Hamilton and Thomas Keane.
 A special prosecutor and grand jury investigated those actions but ultimately chose not to prosecute.
 The name of that CIA official whose torture activities the Post described is Gina Haspel.
 Today, as BuzzFeed’s Jason Leopold noted, CIA Director Mike Pompeo announced that Haspel was selected by Trump to be deputy director of the CIA.

"Rand Paul says he’ll oppose Trump’s CIA, State Department nominees
 
 Personal Liberty Poll Exercise your right to vote.
 Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) says he plans to do everything in his power to block President Donald Trump’s nominations to head the State Department and Central Intelligence Agency over war and torture concerns.
 We told you about Trump’s administration shake-ups and new nominees Tuesday:
 Following what has appeared for months to be a strained relationship between President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the top diplomat is being replaced.
 Trump announced Tillerson’s ouster via Twitter Tuesday, saying: “Mike Pompeo, Director of the CIA, will become our new Secretary of State.
 He will do a fantastic job!
 Thank you to Rex Tillerson for his service!
 Gina Haspel will become the new Director of the CIA, and the first woman so chosen.
 Congratulations to all!” This is yet another big shake-up for Trump’s still-young administration — and it may be the most important one to date.
 The move creates some big questions about both the administration’s foreign policy ambitions as well as the president’s relationship with the deep state.
 “I will oppose both Pompeo’s nomination and Haspel’s nomination,” Paul said Wednesday.
 The Kentucky lawmaker is the first Republican to say he will attempt to block the nominees; but he isn’t the first Republican to express concern.
 Sen. John McCain of Arizona said Tuesday that he wanted answers about Haspel’s background running CIA torture programs prior to her confirmation.
 Paul contends that the Trump nominations directly contradict promises the president made on the campaign trail.
 “I’m perplexed by the nomination of people who love the Iraq War so much that they would advocate for a war with Iran next.
 I think it goes against most of the things President Trump campaigned on,” he said.
 The lawmaker added that he can’t support Haspel, whom he described as having expressed “joyful glee” at being involved in torture programs in the past.
 “I find it just amazing that anyone would consider having this woman at the head of the CIA,” Paul said.
 With Paul’s defection and McCain likely to be undergoing treatment for brain cancer at the time of the vote, Trump’s White House will likely be left scurrying for Democrat support to secure the majority necessary for the nominees to be confirmed in the Senate.

"Rand Paul: I'll Do ""Whatever It Takes"" To Block Haspel & Pompeo
 
 Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) has expressed some of my thoughts when it comes to the newly nominated Secretary of State and director of the Central Intelligence Agency.
 Paul told CNN’s “State of the Union” and CBS News’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday that he would do ""whatever it takes,"" including a filibuster, to block the confirmations of Mike Pompeo to head the State Department and Gina Haspel to run the CIA.
 “You really want a diplomat to be in charge of the State Department, not someone who is advocating for war,” he told “Face the Nation.”
 “I frankly think that Pompeo’s positions are too much of an advocate for regime change, really everywhere,” he added.
 ""I don't think our policy ought to be for regime change, so I think Pompeo really isn't a good fit to be a diplomat.""
 He's right, too.
 Pompeo has advocated for regime change in North Korea.
 We've seen exactly what happens when the US gets involved in such types of regime changes, and the truth is that they really don't work out too well.
 As for Haspel, Paul told ""Face The Nation,"" ""She oversaw an illegal black ops operation in Thailand that included torture.
 I don't think torture is what America is about.""
 On ""State of the Union,"" Paul added, ""I'll do whatever it takes, and that includes filibuster"" to block their confirmation.
 ""I don't have the power to stop her nomination,"" he said of Haspel.
 ""There's enough votes she'll eventually win.
 Few things in life .
 .
 .
 [are] worth standing up saying 'enough is enough.'""
 ""We are not a people that should be so fearful or vengeful that we think that torture is somehow acceptable,"" he added.
 ""On what level could torture ever be acceptable?
 We should make a stand on this.
 She should never lead the CIA.""
 Both nominations may face tough confirmation hearings, but it seems that many Americans are just fine with these types of people being in these types of offices.
 The only thing I can think for that kind of reasoning is that people do not know their Constitution and understand exactly what Senator Paul is trying to warn America about.
 Instead, people are acting out of emotion and fear.
 Do I believe we should be concerned about North Korea?
 Sure, but I'm hardly worried that they will actually attack us.
 Am I concerned about jihadis?
 Yep, but I'm not sure I've seen any real hard evidence that torturing them has produced any information that has led to stopping terror attacks.
 And before you tell me about the media reports and CIA involvement, just keep in mind that a former journalist, who is now dead, told the world that the media lies for the CIA.
 So, I'm wary of media reports that claim there have been results from the tactics used.
 Trump has obviously had praise for both Pompeo and Haspel, but then again, his administration has quite a bit of turn over too.
 Mike Pompeo, Director of the CIA, will become our new Secretary of State.
 He will do a fantastic job!
 Thank you to Rex Tillerson for his service!
 Gina Haspel will become the new Director of the CIA, and the first woman so chosen.
 Congratulations to all!
 — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 13, 2018
 We'll see how things turn out and I'm sure Senator Paul is not issuing an empty threat in the matter.

"Bill Clinton: ‘I Did The Right Thing’ During Lewinsky Affair; ‘I Do Not’ Owe Her Apology
 
 Former president Bill Clinton has spoken out about what happened during his affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
 Among other things, Clinton says Lewinsky is not owed an apology from him and he “did the right thing.”
 As reported by CNN, Speaking to Today, Clinton defended his decision to remain in office following the scandal.
 “A lot of the facts have been conveniently omitted to make the story work, I think partly because they’re frustrated that they got all these serious allegations against the current occupant of the Oval Office and his voters don’t seem to care,” Clinton said, pointing to a series of sexual misconduct allegations against current President Donald Trump, who has denied them.
 “I think I did the right thing.
 I defended the Constitution.”
 In an essay for Vanity Fair published earlier this year, Lewinsky said she was questioning the narrative surrounding the affair, which played a central role in Clinton’s eventual impeachment.
 “Now, at 44, I’m beginning (just beginning) to consider the implications of power differentials that were so vast between a president and a White House intern,” she wrote.
 “I’m beginning to entertain the notion that in such a circumstance the idea of consent might well be rendered moot.”
 When asked if he owed Lewinsky an apology, President Clinton told NBC‘s Craig Melvin, “No, I do not — I have never talked to her.
 But I did say publicly on more than one occasion that I was sorry.
 That’s very different.
 The apology was public.” Although some may not have taken what Clinton said as an apology, he did publicly acknowledge at the National Prayer Breakfast in 1998 that he had “sinned.”
 “I don’t think there is a fancy way to say that I have sinned.
 It is important to me that everybody who has been hurt know that the sorrow I feel is genuine — first and most important, my family, also my friends, my staff, my Cabinet, Monica Lewinsky and her family, and the American people.”

"Bill Clinton: 'Public apology to Monica Lewinsky was enough'
 
 'I felt terrible then and I came to grips with it.'
 Former President Bill Clinton said his public apology for his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky was enough.
 NBC’s “Today” show correspondent Craig Melvin asked Clinton in an interview aired Monday if he had ever apologized to Lewinsky, who was 22 and Clinton’s subordinate when they began an affair more than two decades ago.
 “I apologized to everybody in the world,” Clinton said of his public apology.
 Melvin followed up by asking Clinton if he had ever apologized privately.
 “I have never talked to her.
 But I did say publicly on more than one occasion that I was sorry.
 That’s very different.
 The apology was public,” he said.
 Clinton made his public apology in 1998 during the National Prayer Breakfast.

 “I don’t think there is a fancy way to say that I have sinned,” he said there.
 “It is important to me that everybody who has been hurt know that the sorrow I feel is genuine — first and most important, my family, also my friends, my staff, my Cabinet, Monica Lewinsky and her family, and the American people.”
 Clinton told Melvin that at the time the affair became public, “I felt terrible then and I came to grips with it.” He said later in the interview: “I dealt with it 20 years ago plus … I’ve tried to do a good job since then with my life and my work.”
 Clinton also said that he did not regret his decision to fight impeachment, and noted that he left the White House $16 million in debt from his defense.
 Clinton and author James Patterson appeared on “Today” to promote their jointly authored novel “The President is Missing.”
 In an apparent response to the “Today” interview, Lewinsky tweeted Monday that she is “grateful to the myriad people who have helped me evolve + gain perspective in the past 20 years.”
 She also tweeted a link to a personal essay she wrote in February for Vanity Fair on the 20th anniversary of the investigation into the affair, in which she admitted that she suffers from PTSD over the fallout from the investigation and publicity, and that the #MeToo movement had changed her perspective on the affair and its aftermath.

"Bill Clinton insists he doesn't owe Monica Lewinsky an apology
 
 Former President Bill Clinton insisted in a weekend interview that he doesn't owe a personal apology to Monica Lewinsky, the former White House intern whose adult life has been defined by their inappropriate sexual affair and the global scrutiny that followed.
 'No,' he told NBC in an interview airing Monday on the 'Today' show.
 'I do not – I have never talked to her.
 But I did say publicly on more than one occasion that I was sorry.'
 'I apologized to everybody in the world,' Clinton said, implying that was enough.
 And the flustered former president, more famous for his Don Juan-like seductions than for his policy legacy, portrayed himself, not Lewinsky, as history's victim in the mass-media's retelling of the 1990s saga.

 Her too: Lewinsky has emerged as an anti-bullying activist and now says Clinton engaged in a 'gross abuse of power' by seducing her
 'A lot of the facts have been omitted to make the story work,' he declared, 'I think partly because they're frustrated that they got all these serious allegations against the current occupant of the Oval Office and his voters don't seem to care.'
 And Clinton complained in the interview that he left the presidency financially ruined because of the costs associated with the legal consequences of his actions.
 'Nobody believes that I got out of that for free,' he said.
 'I left the White House $16 million in debt,'
 He's worth about $80 million today, aided by an aggressive schedule of speaking events – many of which paid him six-figure fees for individual appearances.
 In a March essay for Vanity Fair magazine, Lewinsky wrote that 'what transpired between Bill Clinton and myself was not sexual assault, although we now recognize that it constituted a gross abuse of power.'
 Clinton is now on a book tour with co-author James Patterson but got pointed questions from NBC in an interview that aired Monday morning
 Clinton, pictured denying his May-December affair when he was president, was already noted at the time for his lothario habits
 But decades later, she's still traumatized by the aftermath of being identifed globally as the your woman the President of the United States kept on the side and used for his own pleasure just a few feet from the Oval Office.
 'I’m sorry to say I don’t have a definitive answer yet on the meaning of all of the events that led to the 1998 investigation,' Lewinsky wrote of the public humiliation that played out in seeming slow motion.
 'I am unpacking and reprocessing what happened to me.
 Over and over and over again.'
 Clinton is launching a book tour to promote 'The President is Missing,' a fictional political thriller co-written with the famed author James Patterson.
 He accused interviewed Craig Melvin of 'ignor[ing] gaping facts in describing this, and I bet you don't know you don't know them.'
 'This was litigated 20 years ago.
 Two-thirds of the American people sided with me.'
 Lewinsky is pictured on September 21, 1998 meeting with then-president Bill Clinton at a White House function
 If he were president today, he said later, his most famous extramarital affair wouldn't 'be an issue, because people would be using the facts instead of the imagined facts.'
 Patterson, too, defended Clinton – by comparing his sexual affairs in office with those of two preceding Democratic presidents.
 'It's 20 years ago, come on!'
 he blasted Melvin.
 'Let's talk about JFK.
 Let's talk about, you know, LBJ.
 Stop already!'
 Clinton piled on.
 'You think President Kennedy should have resigned?
 Do you believe President Johnson should have resigned?
 Someone should ask you these questions because of the way you formulate the questions,' he jabbed.
 'I dealt with it 20 years ago, plus.'
 Suddenly philosophical and seeming to take a longer view of history, Clinton said: 'I have tried to do a good job since then with my life and with my work.
 That's all I have to say to you.'

"More UK Sharia: Firefighter Suspended For Supporting Tommy Robinson
 
 No one can say this is not what this is.
 The Sharia is being implemented in the United Kingdom and the Muslims are ready to seek total control.
 The latest evidence of that fact is the suspension of a firefighter who simply voiced his support for the English Defence League's founder, Tommy Robinson.
 A firefighter with Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service took to Facebook to state that he had been suspended from his job over giving support to Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, aka Tommy Robinson.

 Now, a firefighter has taken to his social media account “Jono Booth” and claims to have been suspended after supporting Robinson on Facebook.
 The open account account messaged publicly in support of jailed Robinson.
 After a number of messages, the account claimed the firefighter was leaving Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service after being suspended over his conduct on Facebook.
 The post read: “Well after 22 years in the fire service as a firefighter for Nottinghamshire, yesterday I had a phone call from the fire service saying that I’ve been suspended from duty with immediate effect and I had to hand in my on call alerter and photo I.D card.
 “On asking for what reason this was happening I was told I was going to be investigated on some of the content I had recently put on Facebook.” He added: “Since yesterday morning’s phone call from them I have since handed my notice in at the fire service.
 “Firefighter Booth signing off.”…
 Robinson was arrested, tried, and sentenced to 13 months within an hour for simply reporting outside a criminal trial involving a Muslim rape gang at Leeds Crown Court.
 The judge also put a gag on the press so they were not allowed to report on the arrest, and many reputable outlets complied by removing their stories.
 Robinson was denied due process, according to the judge.
 Robinson has been at the forefront of exposing the criminal elements in Islam.
 Just last week I reported on his previous comments about being incarcerated earlier and that it might be a plot to get rid of him in prison.
 This isn't far-fetched.
 In March, we reported on Britain First's Paul Golding was attacked by two inmates at HMP Elmley, on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent.
 Golding was found guilty on 7 March at Folkestone Magistrates’ Court of religiously-aggravated harassment alongside deputy leader Jayda Fransen which they carried out in Kent in May last year.
 The court heard the pair launched a political campaign in which they claimed to be trying to expose Muslim men who were the subject of a rape trial.
 So, expose the Islamists fro who and what they are and what Islam's founder not only taught them, but modeled for them, and you may just find yourself in jail in the UK.
 Sadly, the same scenario is making some strides in the US, as well.
 Free Tommy Robinson protests are set for this weekend, and Dutch MP Geert Wilders has said he will join those protests.
 Wilders has called Robinson's imprisonment a ""disgrace.""
 He told Breitbart:
 Tommy Robinson was arrested on May 25 outside Leeds Crown Court after using social media to broadcast details of an ongoing trial which was subject to reporting restrictions.
 He was arrested, brought before a judge, and sentenced within five hours.
 The judge ordered a media ban on his arrest and imprisonment, even forcing British publications to delete their articles about the case.
 Such measures are common practice in North Korea and Saudi Arabia.
 It is sad to see how Britain, the cradle of Western democracy and the rule of law, is fast descending into tyranny.
 Tommy is a hero.
 It is a disgrace that he is still in jail.
 I have been invited to a major protest demonstration in London next week, and I will be coming.
 Free Tommy now.
 Indeed!
 Free Tommy Robinson now!

"Who Is Behind the Internet Thought Police?
 
 An article, “What the Red Pill Means for Radicals,” published on June 7 in the ironically named publication Fair Observer might have passed unnoticed as yet another uninformed, biased and ideologically motivated attack on all who ever get labeled “extremists.” The piece is so riddled with non-sequiturs and wild generalizations that it seems almost cruel to rip it to shreds.
 But the author is Bharath Ganesh.
 A little online research reveals that Ganesh is currently working at the Oxford Internet Institute — at the esteemed Oxford University — on a research project funded by the European Union to devise ways to disrupt the “far right” online.
 The project in question is under the banner of the Vox-Pol Network of Excellence, which “is designed to comprehensively research, analyse, debate, and critique issues surrounding violent online political extremism (VOPE).”
 This research group is only interested in violent extremism – according to their website.
 “The qualifier ‘violent’ is therefore employed here to describe VOX-Pol’s interest, which is in those that employ or advocate physical violence against other individuals and groups to forward their political objectives.
 The extremist nature of the politics in which VOX-Pol is interested is thus not decided upon by project participants, but by the decision of those involved in particular types of politics to advocate or employ violence to advance their goals.”

 Note the claims – utterly disingenuous, as it turns out – that the labeling of certain people or groups as “violent extremists” is entirely due to their own behavior; in other words, don’t worry, folks, it’s all scientifically objective.
 This research is being used to advise companies who host online platforms, such as Facebook, as well as governments, on how to stamp out online radicalization – using strategies such as working out ways of preventing people from seeing material posted that is deemed unsuitable in some way, or offering them alternative “nice” things to look at.
 This is a seriously important issue.
 The people and political powers behind such initiatives are manipulating behavior online and literally controlling how people think and get information.
 They are the appointed guardians of the online hoi polloi.
 But who guards the guardians?
 For if Dr. Ganesh is in charge, we have some very worrying questions to ask.
 One could start from the observation that the article is certainly not an academic piece, and gives no concrete evidence for any of the sweeping claims it makes about the so-called “alt-right” and the “manosphere”; nor does it, as any academic should do, attempt to test ideas and consider alternative explanations.
 (Oddly enough, this makes it rather like the groups it claims to criticize.)
 And the label of “violent extremist” turns out to be used very generously.
 Ganesh makes wild leaps and inferences.
 He talks of Darren Osborne, the perpetrator of the vehicular attack on Finsbury Park Mosque.
 This was a heinous crime, and should rightly be condemned.
 But why did Osborne do this, according to Ganesh?
 The attack “was executed after he had become indignant after watching a BBC broadcast on child sexual exploitation and turned to social media to make sense of it.
 He found a narrative from British counter-jihad groups closely aligned with the alt-right, such as Britain First and the founder of the English Defence League Tommy Robinson.” The British counter-jihad movement is thus swept into the same group of violent extremists as Osborne, because Ganesh “knows” they encouraged him.
 The BBC broadcast was the drama based on real life, Three Girls, which showed real-life events of three of the (very many) victims of the Rochdale Muslim rape gangs.
 Ganesh somehow knows precisely what went on in Osborne’s mind.
 Rather than thinking that it was outrage at the behavior of the gangs of Muslim men of Pakistani background who abused the girls portrayed in Three Girls that caused Osborne to lose his mind and commit his terrible crime, Ganesh blames Obsorne’s act on the likes of Tommy Robinson.
 Yet Robinson explicitly fights AGAINST political violence.
 What “narrative from British counter-jihad groups” can one find which suggests driving vehicles into innocent Muslims standing outside a mosque?
 I’m sure if there was any, Ganesh would, as a researcher at an elite institution, be able to find it.
 But there is none offered – only surmise and Ganesh’s mindreading techniques.
 I suppose if you’re paid to fight online extremism, you’d better find it, or you’re out of a job and short of academic publication.
 We have also the ridiculous idea that Tommy Robinson is “alt-right.” He, in fact, describes himself as a centrist – he’s said he agrees with Labour on some things, the Tories on other things, and he left the EDL precisely because he didn’t like the infiltration by the far right.
 He shows no hint of racism or of white supremacism.
 The writer of this shoddy article is working at one of the most elite universities in the world, on research funded by the European Union, and giving advice based on this sloppy thinking to those who are in charge of manipulating and policing the communications and information we have online.
 We have to ask.
 Is it simply a coincidence that Tommy Robinson is now in prison, and that a “researcher” who presents such a misleading account of Robinson is currently actively engaged in consultation with Oxford University and the European Union in advising how to disrupt Robinson’s activities, reinforcing the lies and misrepresentations about him to those in power?
 There’s more.
 Bharath Ganesh’s profile tells us this: “During his Ph.D., Bharath was also a Senior Researcher at Tell MAMA, a national project dedicated to mapping and monitoring anti-Muslim hate in the United Kingdom.
 He has given evidence in the Houses of Parliament on governance, extremism, gender, and hate crime and authored a number of reports in this area.”
 Is it simply a coincidence that this “researcher,” prior to coming to Oxford University, worked for Tell Mama, that factory for the production of bogus claims about Islamophobia?
 Who runs the Internet runs the world.
 Is this a partnership between Europe’s governments, the Internet giants, and Islamic influence?

"Geert Wilders Puts the Political Elites On Notice
 
 Geert Wilders spoke at a massive rally for Tommy Robinson on Saturday.
 20,000 people came out to call for Tommy’s release, and Wilders took the opportunity to put the political elites of Britain and continental Europe on notice.
 “Our governments,” Wilders declared, “sold us out with mass immigration.
 With Islamization.
 With open borders.
 We are almost foreigners in our own lands.
 And if we complain about it, they call us racists and Islamophobes.
 But I say, no more!
 And what do you say?
 No more!
 And that’s right: enough is enough.
 We will not be gagged anymore.
 No more tyranny.”
 It was extraordinary that the British authorities allowed Wilders into the country at all.
 Several years ago he was banned from entering the country, but although the ban was reversed on appeal, the British government recently banned Martin Sellner, Brittany Pettibone, Lauren Southern and Lutz Bachmann from entering, all for the crime of opposing jihad terror and Sharia oppression, and thereby made it clear that it is more authoritarian and unwilling to uphold the freedom of speech than ever – at least when it comes to criticism of Islam, Muslim rape gangs, and mass Muslim migration.
 Even worse, the bannings of Sellner, Pettibone, Southern, and Bachmann were just part of a long pattern.
 Pamela Geller and I were banned from entering Britain in 2013, apparently for life, also for the crime of telling the truth about Islam and jihad.
 Meanwhile, Britain has a steadily lengthening record of admitting jihad preachers without a moment of hesitation.
 Syed Muzaffar Shah Qadri’s preaching of hatred and jihad violence was so hardline that he was banned from preaching in Pakistan, but the UK Home Office welcomed him into Britain.
 The UK Home Office also admitted Shaykh Hamza Sodagar into the country, despite the fact that he has said: “If there’s homosexual men, the punishment is one of five things.
 One – the easiest one maybe – chop their head off, that’s the easiest.
 Second – burn them to death.
 Third – throw ’em off a cliff.
 Fourth – tear down a wall on them so they die under that.
 Fifth – a combination of the above.”
 Theresa May’s relentlessly appeasement-minded government also admitted two jihad preachers who had praised the murderer of a foe of Pakistan’s blasphemy laws.
 One of them was welcomed by the Archbishop of Canterbury.
 Meanwhile, the UK banned three bishops from areas of Iraq and Syria where Christians are persecuted from entering the country.
 But now matters are coming to a head.
 Apparently British authorities decided that it would be too politically costly for them to bar Wilders again.
 And so he entered, and spoke, and gave them a strong dose of the reality that they are determined to ignore and deny.
 Tommy Robinson is in prison today because he violated a court order demanding that he not film videos outside the trials of Muslim rape gangs.
 Clearly the government’s intent was to make sure that as few people as possible discovered the truth about its massive, years-long cover-up of those rape gangs, and refusal to prosecute the perpetrators.
 Theresa May and company obvious hope that other Britons who are furious about the sacrifice of thousands of British girls to the idols of “diversity” and “multiculturalism” will see what happened to Tommy, and be frightened into silence.
 The British government, in imprisoning Tommy Robinson, has shown itself willing to incarcerate people for having opinions that it considers unacceptable.
 That heralds the death of Britain as a free society and the beginning of an authoritarian police state there, unless this slide to totalitarianism is stopped now.
 British public figures, whatever criticism they have leveled against Tommy Robinson in the past, should be calling for him to be freed today, or else they will be exposing themselves as supporting the degeneration of Britain into a police state.
 Wilders addressed this endeavor head-on, declaring: “We will not be silenced.
 We will not be intimidated.
 And we tell the governments, we are not afraid of you.
 We will never surrender.
 We will stand strong and do our duty.
 We will defend our civilization.
 And we will protect our people.”
 Wilders added: “And I tell you, to the governments.
 You can throw us in jail, but you will never defeat us.
 Because, my friends, for every Tommy whom you imprison, thousands will rise up.
 So take notice, Theresa May.
 Take notice, Dutch Prime Minister Rutte.
 Take notice, Mrs. Merkel or President Macron.
 Take notice: the future is ours and not yours.
 We will defeat you politically, because we, my friends, we are the people.”
 If Wilders’ words don’t prove true, it will be because the death of free societies in Britain and Western Europe is truly at hand.

"#FreeTommy Robinson Rally Draws Tens Of Thousands
 
 This weekend, the #FreeTommy Robinson rally drew upwards of 20,000 supporters, according to organizers, in support of the outspoken critic of Islam and exposer of their crimes in his country and against his tyrannical arrest and imprisonment.
 Among those in attendance at the Saturday rally in London outside Downing Street were UKIP leader Gerard Batten, For Britain leader Anne Marie Waters, former Breitbart London editor-in-chief Raheem Kassam and Dutch opposition leader Geert Wilders.
 Wilders, who had been banned from entering the UK, tweeted out his support of Tommy Robinson prior to speaking to those in attendance.

 Wilders tweeted.
 So proud to support Tommy Robinson and free speech in London today.
 Fantastic crowd!
 London: Massive Crowds Gather to Hear Geert Wilders Demand Tommy Robinson's Release https://t.co/VIddLmcZx9 via @BreitbartNews — Geert Wilders (@geertwilderspvv) June 9, 2018
 In his speech, he encouraged those listening that they were not alone, and said the gathering of the people was meant to be a voice to the UK government to ""Free Tommy Robinson!""
 Batten echoed that sentiment saying, “Tommy Robinson is a political prisoner.""
 “Whatever the legal technicalities of his alleged contempt of court, he was imprisoned more for who he is and what he says rather than what he is supposed to have done.,"" he added.
 “It’s not necessary to agree with everything he says, it’s not necessary to approve of everything he does, but history will judge him as being on the right side of a struggle between good and evil,” Batten continued.
 He then went on to blast the policies of the UK that are truly harming their own people, specifically “widespread, organized, paedophile rape of little girls by organized gangs” while those in authority “brush it under the carpet.”
 “Governments in this country and across Europe are now the enemies of their own people, [and] they promote policies that are against the interests of their own people,” he railed — citing efforts to sabotage Brexit, uncontrolled mass migration, and what he described as “Islamisation” in particular,"" he said.
 “A literalist interpretation of the Mohammedan cult is completely alien to everything our country stands for and our traditional way of life,"" Batten continued.
 “And yet instead of opposing Islamisation, our government is submitting and surrendering to it.
 They have betrayed the British people.""
 “Now, ‘Islam’ means ‘Submission’.
 You either submit, or you resist.
 Are you going to submit?” he asked the crowds.
 “Are you going to resist?”
 The crowd shouted back their support of resisting and not submitting to the Islamization of their culture.
 Sharia Watch founder Anne Marie Waters also spoke at the rally.
 “Our leaders, our media, our police, all prioritize Islam in their decision-making,” she said.
 “Why is it so easy for our state to jail Tommy Robinson, when it is so difficult to jail a group of men found with an underage girl in a bedroom?
 Why is it so much easier to jail Tommy Robinson?
 “Why is it so easy to jail a man for leaving bacon at a mosque, but so difficult to jail jihadis who preach murder and death to the British people?""
 she continued in a line of questioning.
 “Why is it so easy for judges to make rulings that allow known terrorists and jihadists to stay in our country?
 Why is the British government allowing ISIS fighters to return from Syria and threaten our safety?
 “Why do we talk and investigate and get angry about an accidental fire in Grenfell, but are expected to immediately forget — or ‘not look back in anger’ — about the deliberate, ideology-driven murder of British children?""
 Waters went on.
 “And why are Muslims allowed to cover their faces with a black sack while the rest of us are subject to strict security?
 Why are children being mutilated and forcefully raped while the law looks the other way?
 Forcefully married, child married, while the law looks the other way?
 Why?
 Why are animals slaughtered in agony and terror and Halal imposed on all of us in a country that has legislated against unstunned slaughter?
 Why?""
 “Why is it so easy, Theresa May, to jail Tommy Robinson, but so difficult to do anything at all about the monstrous crimes committed in the name of Islam all over this country every day?
 Why?” Waters asked.
 Well, the questions are obviously rhetorical.
 We know why.
 The UK is frightened of the Islamists, and by being frightened into submission, they are being complicit in the crimes of the devout Muslims there.
 My speech at the #FreeTommy protest yesterday.
 We need answers to our questions, and we need an MP in Parliament who will ask them.
 https://t.co/Rxx13odSC8 — Anne Marie Waters (@AMDWaters) June 10, 2018
 Kassam also spoke at the event, reminding supporters of what was happening all across Europe due the mass influx of Muslim migrants.
 Then he encouraged them with a piece of American history.
 “I’m sure we have some American friends in the crowd, on stage, and watching at home,” Kassam concluded.
 “You know there was a man called Paul Revere.
 He rode through the night on his horse.
 He said, ‘The British are coming, the British are coming!’ Well, let you tell you something; we’re here today to say a similar thing: The British are coming back!”
 I do hope that is true, but unless the Brits are going to put the same kind of fear in their representatives that the Muslims are doing, they can't expect to do what they want to do.
 What Britain needs is a return to the God of their forefathers, the One Oliver Cromwell served.
 They need to fear Him more than they do the Islamic terrorists and rape gangs.
 Then, and only then, will they render justice for the Muslim criminals, rid their land of such public idolatry and protect the people like Tommy Robinson who rightly tell the truth.

"Is President Trump a Traitor?
 
 The US Democratic Party is determined to take the world to thermo-nuclear war rather than to admit that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election fair and square.
 The Democratic Party was totally corrupted by the Clinton Regime, and now it is totally insane.
 Leaders of the Democratic Party, such as Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, my former co-author in the New York Times, have responded in a non-Democratic way to the first step President Trump has taken to reduce the extremely dangerous tensions with Russia that the Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama regimes created between the two superpowers.
 Yes, Russia is a superpower.
 Russian weapons are so superior to the junk produced by the waste-filled US military/security complex that lives high off the hog on the insouciant American taxpayer that it is questionable if the US is even a second class military power.
 If the insane neoconservatives, such as Max Boot, William Kristol, and the rest of the neocon scum get their way, the US, the UK, and Europe will be a radioactive ruin for thousands of years.
 House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi (CA), Minority Leader of the US House of Representatives, declared that out of fear of some undefined retribution from Putin, a dossier on Trump perhaps, the President of the United States sold out the American people to Russia because he wants to make peace: “It begs the question, what does Vladimir Putin, what do the Russians have on Donald Trump—personally, politically and financially that he should behave in such a manner?” The “such a manner” Pelosi is speaking about is making peace instead of war.
 The Tyranny of Good In... Paul Craig Roberts, La... Best Price: $5.64 Buy New $5.00 (as of 10:35 EDT - Details)
 To be clear, the Democratic Minority Leader of the US House of Representatives has accused Donald Trump of high treason against the United States.
 There is no outcry against this blatantly false accusation, totally devoid of evidence.
 The presstitute media instead of protesting this attempt at a coup against the President of the United States, trumpet the accusation as self-evident truth.
 Trump is a traitor because he wants peace with Russia.
 Here is Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer (NY) repeating Pelosi’s false accusation: “Millions of Americans will continue to wonder if the only possible explanation for this dangerous behavior is the possibility that President Putin holds damaging information over President Trump.” If you don’t believe that this is orchestrated between Pelosi and Schumer, you are stupid beyond belief.
 Here is disgraced Obama CIA director John Brennan, a leader of the fake Russiagate campaign against President Trump in order to prevent Trump from making peace with Russia and, thus, by making the world safer, threatening the massive, unjustified budget of the military/security complex: “Donald Trump’s press conference performance in Helsinki rises to and exceeds the threshold of high crimes and misdemeanors.
 It was nothing short of treasonous.
 Not only were Trump’s comments imbecilic, he is wholly in the pocket of Putin.
 Republican Patriots: Where are you??
 ?”
 Here are many more.
 And here is more from the CIA bought-and-paid-for BBC.
 NOTICE THAT NOT ONE WESTERN MEDIA SOURCE IS CELEBRATING AND THANKING TRUMP AND PUTIN FOR EASING THE ARTIFICAILLY CREATED TENSIONS THAT WERE LEADING TO NUCLEAR WAR.
 HOW CAN THIS BE?
 HOW CAN IT BE THAT THE WESTERN MEDIA IS SO OPPOSED TO PEACE?
 WHAT IS THE EXPLANATION?
 The Russians, the Chinese, the Iranians, and the North Koreans, as well as the rest of the world, desperately need to notice the extremely hostile reaction to peace on the part of the US Democratic Party, many members of the Republican Party, including the despicable US Republican Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, and the Western Presstitute Media, a collection of people on the CIA payroll according to the German newspaper editor, Udo Ulfkotte, and the CIA itself.
 Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, John McCain, Lindsey Graham, and the rest of the corrupt filth that rules over us are all in the pay of the military/security complex.
 Just go and investigate the donations to their re-election campaigns.
 The 1,000 billion dollar budget of the military/security complex, amplified by the CIA’s front corporations and narcotics business, provides enormous sums with which to purchase the senators and representatives that the insouciant American voters think that they elect.
 Do you know how large 1,000 billion is?
 You would have to live for thousands of years and do nothing for 24/7 except count to reach that figure.
 It is a sum that nurtures the recipients, and the recipients regard it as worth protecting.
 Therefore, the American public gets not representation, but lies that justify war and conflict.
 The military/security complex, about which President Eisenhower warned the American people to no effect, is in desperate need of an enemy.
 In obedience to the military/security complex, the Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama regimes have made Russia that enemy.
 If Trump and Putin do not understand this, they will easily be made irrelevant.
 They both can be assassinated, and that is what the statements from Pelosi, Schumer, McCain, Lindsey Graham, et.
 al., repeated endlessly in the propaganda ministry that is the Western press, encourages.
 Trump can be assassinated or overthrown in a political coup for selling out America to Russia, as members of both political parties claim and as the media trumpets endlessly.
 Putin can be easily assassinated by the CIA operatives that the Russian government stupidly permits to operate throughout Russia in NGOs and Western/US owned media and among the Atlanticist Integrationists, Washington’s Firth Column inside Russia serving Washington’s purposes.

 Americans are so unaware that they have no idea of the risk that President Trump is taking by challenging the US military security complex.
 For example, during the last half of the 1970s I was a member of the US Senate staff.
 I was working together with a staffer of the US Republican Senator from California, S. I. Hayakawa, to advance understanding of a supply-side economic policy cure to the stagflation that threatened the US budget’s ability to meet its obligations.
 Republican Senators Hatch, Roth, and Hayakawa were trying to introduce a supply-side economic policy as a cure for the stagflation that was threatening the US economy with failure.
 The Democrats, who later in the Senate led the way to a supply-side policy, were, at this time, opposed (see Paul Craig Roberts, The Supply-Side Revolution, Harvard University Press, 1984).
 The Democrats claimed that the policy would worsen the budget deficit, the only time in those days Democrats cared about the budget deficit.
 The Democrats said that they would support the tax rate reductions if the Republicans would support offsetting cuts in the budget to support a balanced budget.
 This was a ploy to put Republicans on the spot for taking away some groups’ handouts in order “to cut tax rates for the rich.”
 The supply-side policy did not require budget cuts, but in order to demonstrate the Democrats lack of sincerety, Hayakawa’s aid and I had our senators introduce a series of budget cuts together with tax cuts that, on a static revenue basis (not counting tax revenue feedbacks from the incentives of the lower tax rates) kept the budget even, and the Democrats voted against them every time.
 When the combination of tax cuts with defense budget cuts came up for a vote, the legendary senator Strom Thurmond, a 48-year member of the US Senate from South Carolina, tapped me on the shoulder.
 He said: “son, never set your senator up against the military/security complex.
 He will not be re-elected, and you will be out of a job.” I replied that we were just establishing for the record that under no conditions would the Democrats, who wanted more government, vote for a tax rate reduction even if there was a case that it would cure stagflation.
 He replied: “son, the military/security complex doesn’t care.”
 My emergence from The Matrix began with Thurmond’s pat on my shoulder.
 It grew with my time at the Wall Street Journal when I learned that some truthful things simply could not be said.
 In the Treasury I experienced how those outside interests opposed to a president’s policy marshall their forces and the media that they own to block it.
 Later as a member of a secret presidential committee, I saw how the CIA attempted to prevent President Reagan from ending the Cold War.
 Today, right now, at this moment, we are faced with a massive effort of the military/security complex, the neoconservatives, the Democratic Party, and the presstitute media to discredit the elected President of the United States and to overthrow him in order that the utterly corrupt elite that rule American can continue to hold on to power and to protect the massive budget of the military/security complex that, along with the Israel Lobby, funds the elections of those who rule us.
 Trump, like Reagan, was an exception, and it is the exceptions that accumulate the ire of the corrupt leftwing, bought off with money, and the ire of the media, concentrated into small tight ownership groups indebted to those who permitted the illegal concentration of a once independent and diverse American media that once served, on occasion, as a watchdog over government.
 The rightwing, wrapped in the flag, dismisses all truth as “anti-American.”
 If Putin, Lavrov, the Russian government, the traitorous Russian Fifth Column—the Atlanticist Integrationists—the Chinese, the Iranians, the North Koreans think that any peace or consideration can come out of America, they are insane.
 Their delusions are setting themselves up for destruction.
 There is no institution in America, government or private, that can be trusted.
 Any government or person who trusts America or any Western country is stupid beyond belief.
 The entire Russiagate hoax is an orchestration by the military/security complex, led by John Brennen, Comey, and Rosenstein.
 The purpose is to discredit President trump for two reasons.
 One is to prevent any normalization of relations with Russia.
 The other is to remove Trump’s agenda as an alternative to the agenda of the Democratic Party.
 How America Was Lost: ... Dr. Paul Craig Roberts Best Price: $8.00 Buy New $8.51 (as of 02:00 EDT - Details)
 President Trump is almost powerless.
 Putin, the Chinese, the Iranians, and the North Koreans should recognize this before it is too late for them.
 President Trump cannot fire and arrest for high treason Mueller and Rosenstein.
 And Trump cannot indict Hillary for her numerous unquestionable crimes in plain view of everyone, or Comey or Brennan, who declares Trump “to be wholly in the pocket of Putin,” for trying to overthrow the elected president of the United States.
 Trump cannot have the Secret Service question the likes of Pelosi and Schumer and McCain and Lindsey Graham for false accusations that encourage assassination of the President of the United States.
 Trump cannot even trust the Secret Service, which accumulated evidence suggests was complicit in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and Robert Kennedy.
 If Putin and Lavrov, so anxious to be friends of Washington, let their guards down, they are history.
 As I said above, Russiagate is an orchestratration to prevent peace between the US and Russia.
 Leading military/security complex experts, including the person who provided the CIA’s daily briefing of the President of the United States for many years, and the person who devised the spy program for the National Security Agency, have proven conclusively that Russiagate is a hoax designed for the purpose of preventing President Trump from normalizing relations between the US and Russia, which has the power to destroy the entirety of the Western World at will.
 Here is the report from the retired security professionals who, unlike those still in office, cannot be fired and deprived of a careet for telling the truth.
 Here is what the clued-in Russian Defense Minister Shoigu has to say about the aggressive actions of the West against the Russian homeland.
 If Putin doesn’t listen to him, Russia is in the trash can of history.
 Keep in mind that no media informs you better than my website.
 If my website goes down, you will be left in darkness.
 No valid information comes from the US government or the Western presstitutes.
 If you sit in front of the TV screen watching the Western media, you are brainwashed beyond all hope.
 Not even I can rescue you.
 Nor God himself.
 Americans, and indeed the Russians themselves, are incapable of realizing it, but there is a chance that Trump will be overthrown and a Western assault will be launched against the handful of countries that insist on sovereignty.
 I doubt that few of the Americans who elected Trump will be taken in by the anti-Trump propagana, but they are not organized and have no armed power.
 The police, militarized by George W. Bush and Obama, will be set against them.
 The rebellions will be local and suppressed by every violation of the US Constitution by the private powers that rule Washington, as always has been the case with rebellions in America.
 In the West, which the Russians are so anxious to join, all freedoms are dead—freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of inquiry, freedom of privacy, freedom from arbitrary search, freedom from arbitrary arrest, along with the Constitutional protections of due process and habeas corpus.
 Today there are no countries less free than the United States of America.
 Why do the Russian Atlanticist Integrationists want to join an unfree Western world?
 Are they that brainwashed by Western Propaganda?
 If Putin listens to these deluded fools, Putin will destroy Russia.
 There is something wrong with Russian perception of Washington.
 Apparently the Russian elite, with the exception of Shoigu and a few others are incapable of comprehending the neoconservative drive for US world hegemony and the neoconservative determination to destroy Russia as a constraint on US unilateralism.
 The Russian government somehow, despite all evidence to the contrary, believes that Washington’s hegemony is negotiable.

"The Coming Coup
 
 The annual budget of the military/security complex is $1,000 billion.
 This vast sum is drawn from US taxpayers who have many unmet needs.
 To justify such an enormous budget a major enemy is required.
 The military/security complex and the media and politicians that the complex owns have designated Russia to be that enemy.
 The complex and its political and media agents will not permit Trump to normalize relations with Russia.
 To prevent President Trump from reducing the dangerous tensions between nuclear powers that Washington has created, the military/security complex orchestrated Russiagate, a proven hoax, but believed by many due to its endless repetition.
 The military/security complex orchestrated the false indictments of 12 Russians.
 The military/security complex orchestrated the false arrest of Maria Butina, and so on and on.
 The military/security complex acting through the politicians and presstitutes that it owns and controls has turned the normal everyday responsibility of the President—one acknowledged and acted upon by every previous president—to defuse tensions that could lead to nuclear war into a high crime.
 President Trump is accused of treason for trying to make peace!
 The Tyranny of Good In... Paul Craig Roberts, La... Best Price: $5.64 Buy New $5.00 (as of 10:35 EDT - Details)
 An unaware person might think that this is silly and laugh, but as Finian Cunningham shows, President Trump has been set-up as a treasonous enemy of America.
 We are currently experiencing sedition at the highest levels as the military/security complex unfolds its coup against the elected president of the United States.
 In 1961 President Dwight Eisenhower warned Americans in his last public address that the military/industrial complex was a threat to American democracy.
 Truer words were never spoken by an American president.
 Shortly thereafter, the military/security complex assassinated President John F. Kennedy for working toward peace with Soviet leader Khrushchev.
 To get rid of President Nixon, who made too many arms control agreements with the Soviets and opened to China, the military/security complex used its asset, the Washington Post, to orchestrate the “Watergate crisis” that the military/security complex used to force Nixon’s resignation.
 Now the military/security complex is openly inciting sedition against the President of the United States.
 If this plot succeeds, which is the most likely case, America will be a complete dystopia and all independent voices will be shut down.
 Who can Trump rely on?
 Not on his own political party.
 Not on his own government.
 Not on the print and TV media or NPR.
 Not on Europe.
 Not on the Secret Service.
 Not on the Pentagon.
 Not on the unaware American people.
 Trump has only the “deplorables,” and they are unorganized and will experience retribution once Trump is removed.
 In striving to come to an agreement with Washington, Putin and Lavrov are butting their heads against a stone wall.
 Sooner or later Putin and Lavrov will have to acknowledge that.
 Once Putin and Lavrov realize the true situation, they will understand that war or surrender is their only option.

"Federal Judge Overrides DOJ & Violates First Amendment: Blocks 3D-Printed Gun Plans
 
 In July, I reported that the Department of Justice finally settled with Cody Wilson and Defense Distributed over his 3D-print gun plans being lawful.
 The DOJ surrendered in the matter and accepted the fact that the plans are protected under the First Amendment.
 However, a federal judge, in a lawsuit brought by eight states and the District of Columbia, has blocked the plans from being released.
 The judge should understand that these plans are protected under the First Amendment in the same way that any other printed material is, and that there is no crime that has been committed by making them available to people online.
 Second, if that were not enough, we already know that the Second Amendment protects actual arms from restriction and the right to keep and bear them from infringement.

 Fox News has the story:
 U.S. District Judge Robert Lasnik issued the order a day after eight states sued the government to block a settlement reached by the Trump administration last month allowing a Texas-based company, Defense Distributed, to resume online-sharing of blueprints for the 3D firearms.
 The company was set to allow downloads on Wednesday, although blueprints have been posted since Friday.
 The temporary restraining order blocks the release until the next scheduled hearing on August 10.
 In the meantime, Congressional Democrats have urged President Trump to reverse the decision letting Defense Distributed publish the plans.
 Trump said Tuesday that he's ""looking into"" the idea, saying making 3D plastic guns available to the public ""doesn't seem to make much sense!""
 Doesn't make much sense?
 Are you people serious?
 Why, yes, yes they are serious.
 Deadly serious.
 It makes perfect sense when you have the same people who have absolutely no problem with mothers hiring hitmen to murder their babies in their wombs in the most brutal and barbaric fashion, and then sell off their body parts for profit, if they don't throw them in the trash or flush them down a toilet, calling for computer files to be kept by the government and not be allowed to be released to the public.
 The eight states are the usual suspects, along with the District of Columbia, and we should note which ones they are.
 Washington
 Connecticut
 Maryland
 New Jersey
 New York
 Oregon
 Massachusetts
 Pennsylvania
 Washington's Attorney General Bob Ferguson's office claims the settlement is:
 ...in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act....there is no indication in the settlement agreement or elsewhere that any analysis, study or determination was made by the government defendants in consultation with other agencies, before the federal government agreed to lift export controls on the downloadable guns.
 In fact, the agreement states that it ""does not reflect any agreed-upon purpose other than the desire of the Parties to reach a full and final conclusion of the Action, and to resolve the Action without the time and expense of further litigation.""
 The lawsuit also argues the settlement violates the Tenth Amendment by infringing on states' rights to regulate firearms.
 Washington has a robust regulatory system meant to keep firearms out of the hands of dangerous individuals.
 That system is jeopardized by the Trump Administration's action and will be undermined by the distribution of Defense Distributed's downloadable guns.
 Note that Ferguson forgets that the Tenth Amendment states plainly:
 The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.
 (emphasis mine)
 Since our founders clearly said that our rights come from our Creator, and the Second Amendment acknowledges that the ""right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed,"" I truly wonder where he gets this idea the state has a right to do just that, infringe on the rights of the people by regulating firearms.
 he is reading something into it that is simply not there, but that's a Communist ideology you are seeing there, not an American one.
 Reason reports on the response of Defense Distributed:
 Josh Blackman, one of Defense Distributed's lawyers, said in an email today that ""The District Court in Washington already approved the settlement.
 This latest suit is another collateral attack on a rule-making process that began in the Obama Administration.""
 As reported yesterday, Defense Distributed is already embroiled in its own lawsuit against New Jersey and Los Angeles over those authorities' threats, and simultaneously is fighting Pennsylvania's request for a temporary restraining order against them.
 (Both those states are also part of today's federal lawsuit filed in the Western District of Washington.)
 While the various court filings about this continue to suggest that August 1 is the date on which Defense Distributed will begin distributing the files—which, again, the settlement legally permits them to do—the distribution is already happening.
 Cody Wilson of Defense Distributed is already fundraising off the suit via Twitter.
 He told me five years ago, when I was writing a feature story on the beginnings of his fight with the government over gun-making files, that ""This has been a continuous process of different levels of authority figures trying to stop it from happening and thus allowing it to happen...Of course we are going to succeed—because you all are trying to stop me.
 That seemed natural and ended up being true.""
 So far, that has continued to be true.
 This federal judge should know what the Constitution actually says and should have tossed this frivolous lawsuit in the trash where it belongs.
 Instead, he is demonstrating he is not even fit to sit on the bench, and the attorney generals of each of these states are demonstrating they are not fit to be in the office they are in.
 Speaking of Defense Distributed and Cody Wilson, enter to win this Ghost Gunner 2 and make your own guns at home!

"Texan behind 3D-printed guns vows legal fight as White House endorses court ruling | Bangkok Post: news
 
 CHICAGO - A US gun rights advocate began gearing up for a legal fight Wednesday to be able to publish online blueprints for 3D-printed firearms, as the White House signaled support for a federal judge's decision to block the venture.
 Eight US states and the District of Columbia have argued in court that the blueprints available online to make untraceable, undetectable plastic weapons like this single-shot ""Liberator"" handgun could fall into the wrong hands
 Cody Wilson's Texas-based company Defense Distributed had briefly made the blueprints available online, but Seattle-based US District Judge Robert Lasnik granted an injunction Tuesday to take the material down.
 The Donald Trump administration last month gave permission for Wilson to publish the blueprints, but the White House said Wednesday the president was unaware of the decision and was glad it was being reviewed.
 Eight US states and the District of Columbia sued, arguing the blueprints could allow anyone -- from a teen to a 'lone wolf' gunman -- to make untraceable, undetectable plastic weapons.
 Wilson complied with the judge's order, but put out a call for financial support for the legal battle ahead, including a scheduled August 10 court hearing.
 He told CBS News ahead of the injunction that he believes ""access to firearms is a fundamental human dignity.
 It's a fundamental human right.""
 ""What I'm doing is legally protected,"" he said.
 ""I will go to the appellate level.
 I will go to the Supreme Court.
 I will waste all my time.""
 - President 'glad' for review -
 As uproar was building Tuesday over Wilson's efforts, the president tweeted that making plastic 3D-printed guns publicly available ""doesn't seem to make much sense.""
 White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders elaborated Wednesday, saying the administration's Justice Department had acted on its own in granting Wilson permission to publish the blueprints on his Defcad website -- settling a five-year legal battle.
 ""The Department of Justice made a deal without the president's approval,"" Sanders said.
 ""The president's glad this effort was delayed to give more time to review the issue.""
 Sanders also repeated the administration's claim from a day earlier that existing law already prohibits plastic firearms.
 The National Rifle Association, the nation's most politically influential gun rights group, echoed that claim, contending that the 1988 law made the current 3D-printed gun issue moot.
 ""Regardless of what a person may be able to publish on the Internet, undetectable plastic guns have been illegal for 30 years,"" the NRA said in a statement.
 But Wilson has gotten around the legal prohibition by providing instructions with the digital files for 3D printing his ""Liberator"" plastic gun that call for an approximately six-ounce block of steel to be affixed to the weapon.
 Should those who print the gun follow those instructions, metal detectors would pick up the weapons, thus complying with the law.
 But while users can build the gun, there is no way to ensure they affix metal to it.
 - 'The debate is over' -
 Late Tuesday, dozens of Democratic senators introduced legislation to prohibit the publication of 3D-printable firearm designs, a move gun control groups applauded.
 But some damage was already done.
 Wilson's blueprints had been posted on Defcad before the court order took effect and had already been downloaded thousands of times.
 ""The debate is over.
 The guns are downloadable.
 The files are in the public domain -- you cannot take them back,"" Wilson told CBS.
 Gun control groups nevertheless were relieved by the judge's decision, with the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence calling 3D-printed firearms ""nothing short of a menace to society.""
 ""There is simply no way of telling how much damage has already been done by Cody Wilson's dangerous and reckless actions,"" Brady Campaign co-president Kris Brown said in a statement.
 ""This is a strong step and a clear victory for the entire gun safety movement, but we simply can't let up.""
 Prior to last month, Wilson had actually been losing his drawn-out legal battle, after both a federal district court and an appellate court ruled against him.
 The US Supreme Court declined to take up his case.
 But in a sign of his determination to continue the legal fight, a message on the Defense Distributed website made a public appeal for financial support ""to uncensor the site.""

"11 Children Have Been Rescued From a Muslim Extremist-Run Compound In NM
 
 Eleven children were rescued from a compound in New Mexico which was being run by armed Muslim extremists.
 Authorities found all the children living in deplorable living conditions after raiding the property looking specifically for a three-year-old boy.
 According to The Daily Caller, the police didn’t find the little boy, named Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj, but they did discover 11 other children between the ages of one and 15-years-old being held in the “saddest living conditions and poverty I have seen,” Taos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe said in a statement posted to the agency’s Facebook page Saturday.
 Hogrefe also added that he only saw a few potatoes and a box of rice as food at the compound.
 Abdul-Ghani’s mother reported her son missing after Wahhaj took the boy, who turned 4 on Monday, to the park in Clayton County, Georgia, and didn’t return, The Albuquerque Journal reported.
 She added the boy suffers from a medical condition.
 Investigators believe that the three-year-old boy, who turned four on Monday, they were looking for had been at the compound in earlier weeks.
 Siraj Wahhaj, 39, and Lucas Morten, two very heavily armed men who are believed to be “extremist[s] of the Muslim belief,” were running the horrifying compound, Hogrefe said.
 When police arrived on the scene, Wahhaj was armed with an AR-15-style rifle and several loaded 30-round magazines.
 He also allegedly had on him four loaded pistols.
 According to a report by Fox News, Hogrefe said authorities had conducted surveillance of the compound while looking for the missing boy before he decided Thursday to get a search warrant.
 The warrant was immediately obtained after a Georgia investigator forwarded a message in which someone at the compound reportedly told another person that people who were living in the shanty were starving and needed water.
 “The message sent to a third party simply said in part, ‘We are starving and need food and water,’” Hogrefe said.
 “I absolutely knew that we couldn’t wait on another agency to step up and we had to go check this out as soon as possible.”
 Police stated on Sunday that they are still looking for Abdul-Ghani.

"2 Men, Moms Arrested After Child Found Dead, 11 More Found In ‘Filthy’ New Mexico Compound With Armed ‘Muslim Extremists’
 
 TAOS COUNTY, NEW MEXICO — Two males from Georgia are in custody after TCSO served a search warrant at a makeshift residence that is best described as a “compound” in Amalia, NM.
 Eleven children ranging in age from 1 to 15-years-old were also taken in protective custody and later turned over to New Mexico Children Youth and Families Department (CYFD) for their own health and safety.
 Three women believed to be the children’s mothers were also arrested.
 Thursday afternoon Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe swore out an affidavit for a search warrant that states there is a makeshift compound surrounded by tires and an earthen berm in Costilla Meadows subdivision that he reasonably believed was occupied by adult Lucas Morton and others, including 39-year-old Siraj Wahhaj, who was wanted for child abduction and 3-year-old AG Wahhaj, the child that was abducted.
 This warrant came after a two-month investigation in conjunction with Clayton County, Georgia and FBI investigators.
 According to Sheriff Hogrefe the FBI had recently provided information and surveillance on this location, but they (FBI) didn’t feel there was enough probable cause to get on the property.
 In the press release Sheriff Hogrefe said, “That all changed for me when a message was forwarded to us from a Georgia Detective that we reasonably believed came from someone at the compound – the message sent to a third party simply said in part “we are starving and need food and water”.
 I absolutely knew that we couldn’t wait on another agency to step up and we had to go check this out as soon as possible, so I began working on a search warrant right after I got that intercepted message – it had to be a search warrant and a tactical approach for our own safety because we had learned the occupants were most likely heavily armed and considered extremist of the Muslim belief.
 We also knew from the layout of the compound they would have an advantage if we didn’t deploy tactfully and quickly.”
 On Friday morning, August 3, 2018, eight members of TCSO’s Sheriff’s Response Team (SRT) were assisted by four members of the State OSI unit when they executed the search warrant.
 The “all day” operation went without major incident or any injuries, but when encountered both men initially refused to follow verbal direction and Wahhaj who was held up inside the compound was heavily armed with an AR15 rifle, five loaded 30 round magazines, and four loaded pistols, including one in his pocket when he was taken down.
 Many more rounds of ammo were found in the makeshift compound that consists of a small travel trailer buried in the ground covered by plastic with no water, plumbing, or electricity.
 “The only food We saw were a few potatoes and a box of rice in the filthy trailer,” said Hogrefe.
 “But what was most surprising, and heartbreaking was when the team located a total of five adults and 11 children that looked like third world country refugees not only with no food or fresh water, but with no shoes, personal hygiene and basically dirty rags for clothing.”
 The body of a yound boy was also located, however, it is not clear if the boy is the missing child from Georgia.
 Both males were arrested; Morton was charged with harboring a fugitive and Wahhaj was booked on his no bond Georgia warrant for child abduction.
 The three females believed to be the mothers of the eleven children, Jany Leveille age 35, Hujrah Wahhaj age 38, and Subhannah Wahhaj age 35 were arrested without incident in Taos and were later booked in the Taos Adult Detention Center.
 “We all gave the kids our water and what snacks we had – it was the saddest living conditions and poverty I have seen.”
 None of the adults would give statement to the current whereabouts of AG Wahhaj, but it is reasonably believed he was there a few weeks ago.
 The investigation is fluid and ongoing.

"Couple question why police waited so long to search New Mexico compound
 
 (CNN) A New Mexico couple told authorities months ago they thought a missing Georgia boy and his fugitive father were living in a filthy compound on their property.
 But police did not carry out a search of the property until last week, Taos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe said, because they did not believe they had probable cause in the case.
 That delay is facing scrutiny in the wake of Monday's discovery of a young boy's remains at the compound.
 ""They were dragging their feet.
 They were taking too long,"" said Tanya Badger, who with her husband, Jason, told authorities about the boy's suspected presence at the compound.
 ""Even if they were trying to build a case or whatnot, a child's life is at stake.""
 It's not clear whether the remains are those of Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj, a child with severe medical problems who disappeared from Georgia about nine months ago.
 The remains were discovered in a wretched compound along with 11 starving children, authorities said.
 More details about the horrid compound could be revealed Wednesday when the five adults arrested from the site make their first court appearances.
 Authorities raided the compound in Amalia, New Mexico, on Friday as part of their search for Abdul-Ghani, whose father, Siraj Wahhaj, allegedly abducted him from Georgia in November.
 Neighbors raised alarm about a suspect
 The Badgers , whose land the compound was on, said they saw a boy they thought was Abdul-Ghani in January and February.
 In April, they discovered the boy was listed as missing and his father a fugitive.
 They reported the sightings to state and local law enforcement, but it was months before police moved in, the couple said.
 ""We are just beyond frustrated that they took so long,"" Tanya Badger said.
 New Mexico authorities had suspected the father and son might be at the compound after learning about the abduction in May, the sheriff said.
 But there was not enough evidence for a search warrant, and surveillance of the property didn't identify the pair there.
 ""I had no probable cause to go onto this property,"" Hogrefe said.
 ""In hindsight I wish there was, but we would not have been there lawfully.""
 The sheriff said that ""they did surveillance, both ground and aerial, and photographs were shared with the family and mother of the missing boy.
 The boy Abdul was never identified from those photos.
 Moving forward we knew that there was this compound, but we had very little details about it or who was occupying it.
 These people just kind of (sprang) up very quickly.""
 The authorities' view changed Thursday when they said they received a message about possible starving children living on the compound, and had enough probable cause to put in an affidavit for a search warrant.
 ""We are starving and need food and water,"" the message said, according to authorities.
 Authorities said it was forwarded to them but did not provide details on its origin.
 Compound wasn't searched thoroughly, couple say
 When officers executed a search warrant on the compound, they found a horrifying scene.
 Stacks of tires, piles of trash and plastic sheets surrounded the compound.
 Obscured by the junk was a trailer where the 11 children and five adults were living.
 The children wore dirty rags for clothing with no shoes, and were surrounded by weapons and rounds of ammunition, authorities said.
 ""It was the saddest living conditions and poverty I have seen,"" Hogrefe said.
 The father of the missing boy, Siraj Wahhaj, was arrested at the compound Friday along with his sisters Hujrah Wahhaj and Subhannah Wahhaj and two other adults -- Lucas Morten and Jany Leveille.
 All have been charged with abuse of the 11 children.
 Morten was charged with harboring a fugitive.
 However, the Badgers said that police did not do a thorough job searching the property.
 The couple said they went back over the weekend after they found out Abdul-Ghani wasn't among the 11 children discovered during the raid.
 Tanya and Jason Badger said they told authorities they had seen a boy they thought was Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj.
 They said they were surprised to see the scene was not taped off and was still largely untouched.
 They found two guns, ammo, tactical vests and video cameras that police initially missed, Jason Badger said.
 ""When we first went up there, nothing was overturned,"" he said.
 ""You could tell nobody had looked underneath that, nobody had looked underneath this.""
 Father allegedly took boy in November
 Abdul-Ghani's mother, Hakima Ramzi, could not be reached after authorities announced the discovery of the remains.
 But hours earlier, Ramzi told CNN she had no idea he'd disappear with their son for nine months, only to be found across the country with 11 other children
 ""My husband said he was taking Abdul-Ghani to the park, and didn't come back.
 That was in November 2017.
 When I would ask him where he was, he said he was on his way, he was coming soon, he was just keeping him for the night.
 But I haven't seen him since then,"" Ramzi said Tuesday.
 She said her son cannot walk and suffers seizures, and requires constant medical attention.
 An arrest warrant states that Wahhaj ""wanted to perform an exorcism"" on the child because he believed he was possessed by the devil.
 But Ramzi said her husband was planning to perform a ruqya -- an Islamic practice involving prayer that is believed to help rid a body of illness.
 ""It's not an exorcism.
 That was a translation issue in the court,"" Ramzi said.
 He ""just wanted to pray for Abdul-Ghani to get better.""
 Police stopped the father in Alabama
 In December, days after Ramzi reported her son missing, the child's father was involved in an accident in Alabama, according to a police report.
 The SUV had seven children -- but none of them was listed with Abdul-Ghani's date of birth.
 Siraj Wahhaj is accused of fleeing Georgia with his young son.
 But at the time, the group told Alabama police they were headed to New Mexico for camping, and continued on their way.
 Even though the boy was reported missing, there was no child abduction warrant against Wahhaj because he was married to his son's mother, and they both had equal custody, Clayton County police said.
 The SUV was registered to Leveille, who was also in the vehicle.
 She would later become one of the five adults arrested at the compound in New Mexico.
 The children were taken into protective custody and later turned over to the New Mexico Children, Youth and Families Department.

 On Tuesday, it was reported that 11 children were rescued from an Islamic compound in New Mexico and that a Muslim man from Georgia and four other adults were arrested.
 Now, we are learning what one of the men was attempting to do with these children.
 He was attempting to brainwash and train these kids to carry out school shootings.
 The initial report was placed on social media by Taos County Sheriff's Department.

 The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports on documents they obtained which claims that the adults were training these children to carry out mass shootings in schools.
 The documents claim Siraj Ibn Wahhaj and his co-defendants conducted weapons training at the camp where they were found Friday with 11 children in allegedly “third world” conditions.
 Wahhaj is also wanted in Clayton County in a child abduction case involving his missing son, Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj.
 The documents, which suggest all the adults were involved in the training, say a person serving as a foster parent caring for one of the kids revealed the details about the training.
 The Associated Press confirms the report:

 That's not all.
 A young boy's body was discovered at the site as well.
 AJC reports:
 Siraj Wahhaj learned Wednesday that prosecutors want him held without bond, along with his relatives also arrested at the compound: Lucas Allen Morton, Jany Leveille, Hujrah Wahhaj and Subhannah Wahhaj.
 Siraj Wahhaj is also accused by Clayton County authorities of abducting his son, Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj, in December.
 Authorities are working to determine if the remains of a young boy found near the compound Monday are Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj’s.
 Monday was (or would’ve been) the child’s 4th birthday.
 The court filing says the remains were in a state of decomposition.

 Well, all of this should make Americans feel just comfy, right?
 I mean, after all, Barack Hussein Obama Soetoro Sobarkah is out of office so these things aren't really going on in America, right?
 Here's the thing, while this is making major news, you should be reminded that for decades, at least 22 verified Islamic jihadi camps have existed on American soil under the watchful, or maybe not so watchful, eye of the FBI, including one in the very country I reside in within eyeshot of a nuclear power plant.
 Political correctness needs to be thrown out the window when dealing with those who take the Quran's teachings seriously and actually are devout, not radical, followers of Muhammad.

"Grandfather & NY Imam Confirms Remains At New Mexico Compound Were Missing Boy
 
 A New York mosque imam claims that after speaking with family members, the remains found earlier this week a New Mexico compound where children were being held by Muslims and trained to engage in mass school shootings, are those of his grandson.
 Abdul-ghani Wahhaj, would have turned 4 Monday.
 According to prosecutors, he was kidnapped from his mother in December in Jonesboro, Georgia.
 Remains found at the New Mexico compound this week were believed to be the boy's since his father was arrested at the compound.
 While New Mexico authorities have said they had yet to identify the remains, Siraj Wahhaj, the boy's grandfather claims they are those of Wahhaj.

 Fox News reports:
 The missing boy's grandfather, Siraj Wahhaj, a Muslim cleric who leads a well-known New York City mosque, told reporters he had learned from other family members that the remains were his grandson's.
 The imam said he did not know the cause of death.
 ""Whoever is responsible, then that person should be held accountable,"" Wahhaj said.
 A Georgia arrest warrant accused the boy's father, Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, the imam's son, of kidnapping the child.
 Authorities said the father at some point told his wife he wanted to perform an exorcism on the boy, who cannot walk, suffers seizures and requires constant attention because of a lack of oxygen and blood flow at birth.
 The imam said he was unaware of the training of the children for school shootings, but his mosque has been known to attract Islamic jihadis over the years.
 ""It sounds to me it sounds crazy.
 But I don't know,"" he said.
 ""I make no judgments yet because we don't know.""
 Again Fox adds, ""The imam's mosque has attracted a number of radicals over the years, including a man who later helped bomb the World Trade Center in 1993.""
 Mosque spokesman Ali Abdul-Karim Judan claims that the narrative is being changed because Muslims are involved and that this was nothing more than a ""domestic situation.""
 ""None of the charges had anything to do with anybody teaching anybody shooting to commit acts of terrorism or to go in and shoot up any school,"" he said.
 ""Because it's a Muslim and the circumstances that are surrounding their situation, they want to change the narrative.""
 Eleven children were found in terrible conditions in that compound.
 That's hardly a ""domestic situation.""
 Furthermore, as I reported on Wednesday, both the Associated Press and the Atlanta Constitution-Journal reported on the training.
 The documents claim Siraj Ibn Wahhaj and his co-defendants conducted weapons training at the camp where they were found Friday with 11 children in allegedly “third world” conditions.
 Wahhaj is also wanted in Clayton County in a child abduction case involving his missing son, Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj.

 People can continue to put their heads in the sand all they want to because they know ""nice"" Muslim people, but the fact of the matter is that the history of Islam is anything but nice, polite, just or holy .
 It is a totalitarian, religious/political construct that is full of oppression.
 When you have those that actually believe the Koran and follow in the footsteps of the desert nomad Muhammad , then you will not find radicals, but devout Muslims.
 This appears to be exactly what Siraj Ibn Wahhaj and others arrested at the compound are.
 In either case, it is very sad that a little boy lost his life, possibly at the hands of his Islamic father and others.
 Justice should be served swift, and I don't mean a lengthy jail term.

 When the left made Linda Sarsour into its role model, it climbed into bed with the worst of the worst.
 The father of a missing 4-year-old Georgia boy was training children at a filthy New Mexico compound to commit school shootings, prosecutors alleged in court documents Wednesday.
 The documents say Siraj Ibn Wahhaj was conducting weapons training with assault rifles at the compound near the Colorado border that was raided by authorities Friday.
 Prosecutor Timothy Hasson filed the court documents while asking that Wahhaj be held without bail after he was arrested last week with four other adults facing child abuse charges.
 Authorities are also awaiting word on whether human remains found at the site were those of Wahhaj's son, who is severely disabled and went missing in December in Jonesboro, Georgia, near Atlanta.

 In the court documents, authorities said a foster parent of one of the 11 children removed from the compound had told authorities the child had been trained to use an assault rifle in preparation for a school shooting.
 Taos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe previously said adults at the compound were ""considered extremist of the Muslim belief.""
 He did not elaborate, saying it was part of the investigation.
 CBS News has learned Wednesday that Wahhaj is the son of a Brooklyn imam who was a possible co-conspirator in the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993 -- but was never charged.
 The elder Wahhaj heads the Masjid At-Taqwa, a mosque that has attracted radical speakers over the years.
 Wahhaj met Mahmud Abouhalima when he came to the site to raise money for Muslims in Afghanistan.

 It’s noteworthy that AP would carry this story at all; certainly, neither AP nor the rest of the establishment media is ever so solicitous of those whom they smear as “anti-Muslim” to allow us to tell our side of the story.
 But the imam Siraj Wahhaj is here engaging in some “war is deceit” action.
 His son was on the radar of counterterror officials for 13 years on suspicion of jihad activity.
 He was training school shooters.
 But of course, it’s all because of journalists who supposedly hate Islam and Muslims.

 “The Latest: Compound incident called anti-Muslim propaganda,” Associated Press, August 10, 2018 (thanks to the Geller Report):
 TAOS, N.M. (AP) — The Latest on 11 children found living in a filthy, makeshift compound in New Mexico (all times local): 4 p.m. A representative of a New York mosque says the raid of a ramshackle compound in New Mexico is being used as propaganda against Muslims.
 Ali Abdul-Karim Judan, a spokesman for the mosque, said in a video posted Thursday on Facebook that the incident was a domestic situation that has nothing to do with extremism.
 The grandfather of a severely disabled boy, who authorities say was kidnapped by his father and taken to the compound, has said remains found there are those of his grandson.
 The man is an imam at the New York mosque.
 Judan also cast doubt on a contention by prosecutors that children found at the site were being trained to use assault rifles in preparation for school shootings.
 He said authorities should not have made that claim without stronger evidence.
 The mosque has attracted radicals over the years, including a man who later helped bomb the World Trade Center in 1993….

 If they had been Christian and white, stockpiling weapons and plotting school shootings, with the ringleader being the son of one of the most respected Christian preachers in the country, there wouldn’t have been news coverage of anything else for weeks.
 There would have been feature stories in the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Wall Street Journal.

 He argued that if they had been Christian and white, “we might not be here today.” Despite law enforcement authorities saying that they believe that the children were being trained to attack innocents, and that the adults were radicalized, Judge Sarah Backus released the suspects.

"The Brennan-Rosenstein-Mueller–Comey-Presstitute
 
 Russiagate is an orchestration.
 It is the response of the military/security complex to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign statement that he intended to normalize relations with Russia.
 Trump recognized that the extreme Russiaphobia, which the hegemonic neoconservatives had whipped up since Vladimir Putin’s statement at the Munich Security Conference in 2007 that Russia was a sovereign country and intended to act like one, was a threat to life on earth.
 The neoconservatives, who have controlled US foreign policy since the Clinton regime, are unwilling to accept limitations by any other country on Washington’s ability to act unilaterally.
 When Putin blocked the Obama regime’s invasion of Syria and bombing of Iran, the neoconservatives paid Putin back by using NGOs and Ukranian politicians financed by Washington to overthrow the democratically elected government of Ukraine and to put in office a government hostile to Russia.
 The intent was to use Ukraine, a Russian province for more than three centuries, to create problems for Russia that would absorb Russia’s attention and return a free hand to Washington and Israel in the Middle East and also to evict Russia from its Black Sea naval base in Crimea.
 When Crimeans voted to reunite with Russia, Washington misrepresented the democratic result of self-determination as a “Russian invasion and annexation of Crimea.” Such an extraordinary misrepresentation destroyed any remaining confidence the Russian government might have had in Washington’s veracity.
 The Neoconservative Th... Dr. Paul Craig Roberts Best Price: $11.96 Buy New $19.34 (as of 10:15 EDT - Details) From here relations between the two nuclear powers deteriorated rapidly.
 As I and Stephen Cohen have emphasized, the danger of nuclear war is today far higher than ever during the long Cold War as there is today no trust whatsoever between the two governments.
 Donald Trump is totally correct that nuclear war would be a terminable event and that nothing is more important than restoring a cooperative and mutually respectful relationship between the US and Russia.
 The problem is that the military/security complex sees it differently.
 After 70 years of entrenchment the military/security complex is an independent political force.
 President Eisenhower warned the American people about this likely outcome in 1961 to no avail.
 From the standpoint of the military/security complex, the problem of normalizing relations with Russia is that it downgrades the “Russian threat” that is so essential to the $1,000 billion annual budget of the military/security complex and the power that such a massive budget conveys.
 Only 16 countries in the world out of 195 countries have a GDP greater than $1,000 billion.
 The military/security complex is large enough to be a member of the G-20 and to have its own currency and military.
 Obama’s CIA director, John Brennan, quickly organized the Russiagate conspiracy against Trump.
 Comey, Rosenstein, Clapper, Mueller, McCabe, Peter Strzok and others were, and are, apparently implicated as active participants in orchestrating an alleged collusion between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin to steal the US presidential election.
 Based on deception of the FISA Court, warrants were illegally obtained that became the basis for appointing Mueller as a special prosecutor to construct by whatever means possible a case against President Trump.
 After two years the only evidence we have of Russiagate is that it is a conspiracy against President Trump and the American people.
 Indeed, Mueller, fully aware that there was no Trump-Putin conspiracy, has not bothered to look for any evidence as there can be no evidence of something that did not happen.
 He pulled out of a hat some phony and meaningless indictments of some Russians in order to make it look like there was a conspiracy without having to prove it, but his main focus has been on framing Paul Manafort.
 Mueller’s investigation of Manafort has nothing to do with the Russiagate story line.
 Manafort’s alleged crimes are far outside Mueller’s mandate and took place, if they did, years before the alleged events of Russiagate.
 Manafort’s conviction by a jury on 8 of the 18 counts is being misrepresented by the Trump-hating presstitutes as vindication of the Russiagate investigation and as “A dark day for Trump,” with the presstitutes suggesting a Watergate parallel that will force Trump from office.
 Manafort was found guilty not of Russiagate, but of income tax evasion and misrepresenting his financial position on a loan application.
 We do not know if Manafort is guilty or is simply a victim of Mueller’s frameup and an incompetent jury.
 American juries are notoriously incompetent, which is why 97% of felony indictments are settled with a plea bargain.
 Even the innocent had rather work out a plea arrangement and admit to something that they did not do than to face an insouciant American jury.
 Remember the jury that condemned the survivors of the FBI’s massacre of the Branch Davidians in Waco, Texas, to be locked away for many years so that they could not talk and tell of the mass murder inflicted on a religious group by the FBI.
 It is unclear how much of a crime it can be to misrepresent your financial position on a loan application when one of the causes of the mortgage-backed derivative crisis was the misrepresentation of mortgage applicants on the loan documents by the companies issuing the mortgages.
 Instead of prosecution, Washington relied on the Federal Reserve to bail out the banks holding the misrepresented loans.
 Income tax invasion is the purview of the IRS, not of a special prosecutor who is supposed to be looking for evidence of a Trump-Putin conspiracy.
 The Russia Hoax: The I... Gregg Jarrett Best Price: $13.99 Buy New $12.63 (as of 08:40 EDT - Details)
 So, why did Mueller focus on Manafort?
 Let Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz tell you:
 “All the Special Counsel needs, in order to charge a subject of an investigation with lying to a prosecutor, is a single witnesses willing to contradict the subject.
 “The witness may not only be “singing,” he may also be “composing” — that is, making up or embellishing a story because he knows that the better his story, the better the deal.
 “Under federal law, the testimony of such a “flipped witness” need not be corroborated in order to secure a conviction.
 “Even one question that results in an answer that is contradicted by one witness would be enough to spring the perjury trap.”
 President Trump has made various statements disputing the orchestrated Russiagate accusations that, if Manafort as witness for the Special Prosecutor contradicted, could send the President of the United States to prison for perjury.
 Knowing this, Mueller, in my opinion a proven corrupt person, decided to put the squeeze on Manafort in order to force Manafort to save himself by giving false testimony against Trump.
 This tactic is used every day by state, local, and federal prosecutors.
 Americans who believe the indictments and convictions are unaware that 97% of the time the convictions rest on self-incrimination in order to avoid worse punishment.
 In Manafort’s case it didn’t, or hasn’t, worked.
 Yet.
 Manafort is due for a second trial, this time for allegely acting as an unregistered foreign agent for Ukrainian interests and for making false statements not under oath to the US government.
 Reportedly, Manafort is being held in solitary confinement, a form of torture designed to break a person’s spirit.
 Like Manafort’s first trial, his second trial has nothing whatsoever to do with Russiagate, but you will never learn that from the presstitute media or from the Democratic Party.
 Manafort can still be coerced to say something that can be used to drive Trump from office.
 What about Michael Cohen, a former attorney for Trump?
 Mueller saw no value in the Cohen case and passed it off to a regular US attorney to prosecute.
 Therefore, it would appear not to be part of the Russiagate investigation.
 Cohen avoided a jury and said he was guilty of five counts of personal income tax evasion, one count of making a false statement to a financial institution in order to get a loan, and two counts related to illegal campaign contributions.
 With regard to the campagin contributions, he contradicted his previous statements.
 He said that on Trump’s instruction, he paid off two women who were claiming sexual affairs with Trump.
 The intricacies of American laws relating to politics are often unclear.
 Apparently, the charge is that Cohen used monies raised for a political campaign to pay off two women, who saw and capitalized on an opportunity to extort Trump for money, and this was an illegal use of the money.
 Why a lawyer would pay off women, whose stories might or might not be true, in an illegal way when his client is a multi-billionaire doesn’t make much sense.
 But these are not the kind of questions that the presstitutes are interested in.
 Nevertheless, Cohen’s plea is associated with a case brought by another prosecutor, not by Special Prosecutor Mueller.
 I am not sufficiently familiar with US legal procedures to be able to say how this gets brought back into Mueller’s investigation.
 The facts are this:
 The US military/security complex will not permit any normalization of relations with Russia.
 Period.
 At some point Putin and Lavrov and the idiot Russian Atlanticist Integrationists will have to acknowledge this fact, or Russia will be destroyed.
 Trump, by declaring normalization of relations as one of his two principal goals for his presidency, earned the emnity of the powerful military/security complex.
 By defeating Hillary for the presidency, Trump inflamed the US media’s hatred, committed as the presstitutes are to Identity Politics and hatred of the “white male oppressors” who elected Trump.
 Trump will never be forgiven for preventing the election of the first female president of the United States, an unpardonable crime by a misogynist white male who “grabs women by the pussy.”
 The hatred of Trump by the military/security complex and by the white male hating Identity Politics of the Democratic Party is giving the world the spectacle of an American democratic presidential election being overthrown by a conspiracy between the military/security complex, the Democratic Party, and the whores who constitute the American print and TV media.
 Death of a Nation: Pla... Dinesh D'Souza Best Price: $14.99 Buy New $16.99 (as of 03:35 EDT - Details)
 President Trump stands up for himself on Twitter — I am surprised that Tritter hasn’t suspended his account — but otherwise seems powerless.
 Whoever advised Trump to appoint Rosenstein, a person committed to Trump’s destruction, as deputy attorney general, which is the ruling position in view of the weak and stupid AG Sessions who recused himself from the Russiagate investigation, intended Trump’s destruction.
 A disreputable person committed to Trump’s destruction is appointed by Trump to destroy Trump.
 How can a person so unclued survive?
 As I wrote during the presidential campaign, Trump has no idea of Washington and no idea who to appoint who would support him rather than work against him.
 Consequently, he has a government working against him.
 Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham are working to prevent the Republican Party from supporting the party’s president.
 They could easily succeed.
 The entirety of the House and Senate of both parties is in thrall to the campaign donations of the military/security complex.
 What can President Trump do?
 He could fight, not with words on Twitter, but with the powers of the presidency.
 There is far more evidence that Russiagate is a conspiracy against the President of the United States than there is evidence that it is a Trump-Putin conspiracy to steal the election from Hillary.
 If Mueller can indict on the basis of no evidence, Trump can order the Attorney General to indict on the basis of massive evidence that Russiagate is a conspiracy against the President of the United States.
 Brennan, Comey, Clapper, Mueller, Rosenstein, McCabe, Strzok, CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, NPR, the New York Times, Washington Post, et.
 al., are all members of the conspiracy to overthrow democracy in America and establish the undisputed rule of the military/security complex.
 The idiot presstitutes’ hatred of Trump might leave them unaware of the conspiracy in which they are participating, but there is no doubt that the American presstitutes are engaged in the overthrow of American democracy, however little of American democracy still exists.
 This column is not an endorsement of Trump.
 It is an endorsement of truth, and it is an endorsement of the American people who in their distress and with the best information that they could acquire elected Donald Trump their President.
 Trump is wrong on the environment.
 Environmental protections put in place after years of struggle are being eviscerated by industry polluters who have gained controll over the environmental regulatory agencies.
 This is not a unique happening of the Trump presidency.
 It began under VP Dick Cheney, the real president during the 8 years of the George W. Bush regime.
 Cheney turned the environmental protection regulatory agencies over to industry polluters.
 Trump is wrong on Iran.
 He is in Israel’s hands, hoping that the power of the Israel Lobby can shield him from the presstitutes and the military/security complex.
 What Israel is doing by attempting to use US military force against Iran is unifying a new alliance that is too powerful for the Washington/Israeli alliance.
 Russia, China, Syria, Turkey, Iran, India, and Pakistan are the locations of populations that massively outnumber Washington’s empire.
 Each of these countries are being united by Washington’s stupid and inexplicable actions against each.
 Militarily, Israel is of no consequence.
 Twice the vaunted Israeli Army, capable of nothing but murdering unarmed women and children, were defeated and driven out of southern Lebanon by a few thousand Hezbollah militia.
 Israel is too cowardly to try it a third time, and is relying on the stupid Americans to do the job for them.
 The entire world looks at America and Israel, and what does the world see?
 Two countries, both the result of exterminating the native populations, distrusted and universally hated, both of which survive by purhasing the governments of other countries and by endless lies that describe everyone but themselves and their vassals as evil criminals that must be destroyed.
 For example, the Gaza Strip, the largest concentration camp ever in the world, is being systematically destroyed along with all life within it by Israel under cover of the obvious and transparanent lie that all within Gaza are terrorists outfitted with bomb belts who are committed to the destruction of Israel.
 Not only men of fighting age, but also old men, pregnant women, children, all Palestinians are being murdered by the Israeli military.
 The United States Secretary of State agrees with Israel that all Palestinians must be destroyed, the sooner the better.
 The Chinese are busy taking advantage of the financial opportunities that the idiot Americans forfeit, but otherwise do not seem to have any strategic sense of how to proceed in the drama unfolding in front of their eyes.
 For China, money is now all.
 The Russians are infected with the American propaganda infused into their veins during the Yeltsin era when Russia was an American puppet state.
 Slowly, if not surely, the Russians are coming to their senses and realizing that they have no American “partner.”
 If Trump is defeated and moved off the table, what happens when Russia and China finally realize that there is to be no conciliation with Washington?
 When all the false hopes and bets of the Russian and Chinese governments of conciliation on the basis of mutual economic interests come to naught, what happens?
 It will be the end of life on earth.
 The Russiagate “investigation” appears to be timed to influence the midterm elections with unsubstantiated accusations made just before the elections in an attempt to produce a Democratic Congress that would impeach President Trump on false charges.
 The presstitutes would cover up the frameup.
 In other words, the real election meddling is being done by the Russiagate “investigation.” See here and here.
 Such an impeachment would be a coup.
 The consequence would be deep and permanent divisions in American political life and more rabid Russiaphobia that would result in war.
 The danger is real that the Democrats’ Russiagate “investigation” aided and abetted by the presstitute media will result in nuclear Armageddon.

"Horrifying Details Released: 2 Jihadi Muslims At Deadly NM Islamic Compound Hit With New Charges
 
 Siraj Ibn Wahhaj and one of his devout wives were charged with abuse of a child resulting in the death of a child and conspiracy to commit abuse of a child.
 Law enforcement rushed to destroy the Islamic compound just days after the kidnapping and murder made national news.
 They destroyed evidence, despite the fact that the investigation was new and ongoing.
 New charges were filed against the devout (“extremist)” Muslims.
 For years, the FBI and local law enforcement did nothing about this jihad compound, despite tips and numerous calls from concerned citizens.
 It took the murder of a child to get them to pay attention.
 What is the first thing they do after it is discovered a child was murdered on the compound and several starved to almost certain death?
 They destroyed the compound to cover up both their negligence and what happened there.
 News of what happened there was embarrassing to the Muslim community in the U.S., and making Islam look good seems to be the top priority of law enforcement officials.
 It’s sharia compliance in New Mexico.

"Federal judge rules against Trump administration on 3-D gun blueprint case
 
 (This article by McClatchy-Tribune contains fake news, which we refute at the end.
 –BL)
 A federal judge on Monday issued a preliminary injunction continuing a prohibition on the Trump administration proposal to make available blueprints for so-called ghost guns, untraceable weapons that can be manufactured on a 3D printer, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said.
 California was one of 20 states led by Washington that won the decision from U.S. District Judge Robert S. Lasnik in Seattle.
 The injunction extends a ruling last month that barred the Trump administration from taking steps that would allow the firm Defense Distributed to disseminate 3D gun blueprints.
 “When the Trump Administration inexplicably gave the green light to distribute on the internet blueprints of 3D-printed, untraceable ghost guns, it needlessly endangered our children, our loved ones and our men and women in law enforcement,” Becerra said in a statement.
 “The Trump Administration’s actions were dangerous and incompetent.”
 The action Monday keeps in place a July 31 court decision blocking the Trump administration pending a decision on the merits of a lawsuit by states opposed to the blueprints being published.
 “The Court finds that the irreparable burdens on the private defendants’ First Amendment rights are dwarfed by the irreparable harms the States are likely to suffer if the existing restrictions are withdrawn and that, overall, the public interest strongly supports maintaining the status quo through the pendency of this litigation,” Lasnik wrote in his decision.

 The radical leftist gun grabbing anti-liberty California General Xavier Becerra is lying when he says the “Trump Administration inexplicably gave the green light to distribute on the internet blueprints of 3D-printed, untraceable ghost guns.” The Department of Just(Us) settled a 1st Amendment claim filed by Cody Wilson, who created the code for 3-D guns.
 It was a case the government was about to lose.
 The settlement was approved by a federal judge.
 Becerra’s statement, “it needlessly endangered our children, our loved ones and our men and women in law enforcement,” is preposterous left-wing political argle-bargle.
 I suspect the Washington judge’s stay will be overturned on appeal, but certainly will if it makes it to the Supreme Court.
 The federal government has no standing to restrict speech in this manner.

"FBI Arrests 5 Muslims From New Mexico Jihad Compound Days After Multiple Charges Were Dropped
 
 Just days after a district judge dropped all charges against three of the Muslim jihadis at the New Mexico terror compound where a child was killed and 11 other children were being trained to commit jihad in mass school shootings, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has stepped up to arrest five Islamists, but the charges are no longer the same.
 Remember, this all occurred because the district attorney failed to file for a preliminary hearing within 10 days and didn’t even bother to show up for court.

 SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) - Federal prosecutors say the FBI has arrested five former residents of a ramshackle compound in New Mexico on firearms and conspiracy charges as local prosecutors dropped charges in the death of a 3-year-old boy at the property.
 Taos County District Attorney Donald Gallegos said Friday his office will now seek grand jury indictments involving the death.
 Gallegos said seeking indictments will allow more time to gather evidence.
 All five people will remain in custody pending a Tuesday hearing in federal court.
 The U.S. Attorney's Office in Albuquerque said compound resident Jany Leveille has been charged with being an alien unlawfully in possession of firearms and ammunition.
 She is a Haitian national.
 The other four members are charged with conspiring with Leveille.
 And the death of the three-year-old?
 Nothing!
 And what of the training of little jihadis?
 Nothing!
 “The defendants, Jany Leveille, 35, a Haitian national illegally present in the United States, Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, 40, Hujrah Wahhaj, 37, Subhanah Wahhaj, 35, and Lucas Morton, 40, are charged in a criminal complaint that was filed earlier today in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico,” the bureau said in a statement.
 “The criminal complaint charges Jany Leveille with being an alien unlawfully in possession of firearms and ammunition in the District of New Mexico from Nov. 2017 through Aug. 2018,” the bureau said.
 “The criminal complaint charges the other four defendants with aiding and abetting Leveille in committing the offense, and with conspiring with Leveille to commit the offense.”
 Yet, in the midst of all of this, don't forget that the FBI ignore the intelligence that was provided to them, just like they have in many cases, which, if they had acted, they may have saved the little boy's life.
 In the meantime, the New Mexico district attorney who failed to file for a preliminary hearing within 10 days and didn’t show up for court is vowing to pursue prosecution of these jihadis.
 “The actions yesterday by the district judges do not affect our continuing efforts to prosecute the individuals as charged originally,” Eighth Judicial District Attorney Donald Gallegos said in a statement on Thursday.
 “While we disagree with the judges, they did their jobs.
 We will continue to do ours.
 “Going forward, our options are to refile the charges or take the cases to the grand jury.
 We are assessing and will decide which avenue to pursue.
 What is important to know is that we will continue to pursue prosecution of the cases.”
 StatementThe actions yesterday by the district judges do not affect our continuing efforts to prosecute the... Posted by Eighth Judicial District Attorney on Thursday, August 30, 2018
 He also sought to fight back against criticism in his failure to perform his job.
 “Finally, I have always welcomed criticism and, as public servants, our judges should also,” Gallegos said in the statement.
 “However, I ask that you be civil and respectful in your criticisms as that is more constructive.
 Cussing and threatening the people involved will not accomplish justice and serves no useful purpose.
 Remember, you do not have all the facts.
 That will develop as the cases progress.""
 Yeah, well, that's about as trustworthy as the FBI in this matter.
 This latest move, while welcome, may only be a response to President Donald Trump's vow to ""get involved.""
 However, I ask, why were you not involved in the first place, Mr. President?
 According to the Constitution, you, and you alone, are the sole head of the executive branch, and as such you are where the buck stop in making sure the laws are faithfully executed.
 So, if Trump is going to fire Sessions, perhaps he should stop talking about it and get to it and actually put someone in the Justice Department as attorney general who will do the job faithfully, and by that, I don't mean Trey Gowdy.
 I mean someone who is serious about justice, not political grandstanding or covering up criminal activity.
 Until then, I'll consider this the means the FBI will use to engage in the further coverup of what really took place at that compound beyond the bulldozing of a crime scene, and possibly, their own complicity.

 TEEN FROM NEW MEXICO COMPOUND SAYS HE WAS TRAINED FOR JIHAD: FBI TAOS, N.M. (REUTERS) – A 13-YEAR-OLD BOY WHO WAS PART OF GROUP TAKEN INTO CUSTODY AT A SQUALID NEW MEXICO COMPOUND LAST MONTH HAS TOLD FBI AGENTS HIS MOTHER’S BOYFRIEND WAS TRAINING HIM TO CONDUCT “JIHAD” AGAINST NON-BELIEVERS, ACCORDING TO FEDERAL COURT DOCUMENTS.
 By Andrew Hay, Reuters, September 2, 2018: The boy was among 11 children and five adults living at the compound in Taos County when it was raided on Aug. 3 by local sheriff’s deputies who discovered a cache of firearms and the children living without food or clean water.
 The dead body of a three-year-old boy was found buried at the site later They initially faced state charges, then on Friday, the five adults including a Haitian woman described as the group’s leader, 35-year-old Jany Leveille, were arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and accused of conspiracy and firearms offenses.
 In an affidavit filed in support of a criminal complaint, an FBI special agent wrote that Leveille’s 13-year-old son told investigators that his mother’s boyfriend, Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, 40, wanted to “get an army together” and train them for jihad.
 The boy told agents that Ibn Wahhaj trained him and another of Leveille’s teenage sons in firearms and military techniques, including rapid reloads and hand-to-hand combat, and told them jihad meant killing non-believers on behalf of Allah, according to the affidavit filed in U.S. District Court in New Mexico.
 The 13-year-old also told the FBI that his mother believed she received messages from God, and that he watched her and Ibn Wahhaj perform supposed “exorcism” rituals over the three-year-old boy, including one during which the boy choked and his heart stopped, according to the special agent’s affidavit.
 The teenager said his mother and others at the compound told him not to talk to anyone about the three-year-old ever being at the compound because they would “all go to jail.” Defense lawyers have said that the five adults were exercising their constitutional rights to practice their religion and own firearms, and that the group is being discriminated against because they are black and Muslim.
 The defense attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment on Saturday.
 The five defendants came under FBI surveillance in May after Leveille wrote a letter to Ibn Wahhaj’s brother asking him to join them and become a “martyr,” state prosecutors have said.
 They are due to appear in court in Albuquerque on Tuesday.

 Keith Ellison CONFRONTED About Domestic Violence Allegations Produced by Sean CampbellAs he arrived for a campaign event in Minnesota on Saturday, Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN) was confronted by investigative journalist Laura Loomer about the numerous domestic violence allegations that have been brought against him by two different women.Loomer questioned Ellison about a 2005 police report filed by Amy Alexander, a Democrat activist who he had a relationship with.
 With the police report in hand, Loomer asked Ellison to explain why the police report says there was a domestic violence call to Alexander's house, despite the fact that Ellison has denied the allegations.Please Support my Independent Journalism: http://bit.ly/loomeredTHANK YOU IN ADVANCE FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTION!
 Posted by Laura Loomer on Monday, September 3, 2018
 His supporters continuously tried to block Loomer, even trying to put their hands on her, cover up her camera and getting in her way of asking honest answers that Ellison owes the people whom he is asking to vote for him.
 Loomer asked why the police were called to Amy Alexander's house in 2005 over domestic violence.
 Ellison was in a relationship with Alexander at that time, but has denied the allegations.
 He fails, however, to relay his side of the story.
 However, 911 call documents show that Alexander named Ellison as her assaulter.

 What my son said is true.
 Every statement he made was true.
 @keithellison, you know you did that to me.
 I have given every opportunity to get help and heal.
 Even now, u r willing to say my son is lying and have me continue to leak more text and info just so others will believe him — Karen Monahan (@KarenMonahan01) August 12, 2018
 What's amazing is that Democrats cover for their own, ignoring the obvious hypocrisy they demonstrate when they opponents are accused of such things.
 Even one woman in the Loomer video says, why are they waiting till now to bring this forward?
 Well, for Ms. Monahan, perhaps that could be asked, but not for Amy Alexander.
 That report was filed more than a decade ago.
 It appears that with Ms. Monahan's claims and Keith Ellison's unwillingness to address the public with his side of the story that perhaps, he has not changed his ways at all.
 In fact, he can more than likely justify his actions based upon the demonic teachings of Muhammad in the Koran.
 He has already won the primary to be Minnesota's AG.
 Will the people not demand justice and vote a Communist-backed, Muslim, accused woman abuser into the office of prosecuting criminals?

"Texas: Cop Walks Into Home She Thought Was Hers, Kills Innocent Homeowner—Not Arrested
 
 Dallas, TX — Highlighting the sheer insane state of law enforcement in America today is a tragic story out of Dallas this week.
 An off-duty police officer walked into the wrong home after getting off shift, thought the homeowner was an intruder, and killed him.
 And, she has not yet been arrested.
 The victim was 26-year-old Bothan Shem Jean who was most likely startled by someone coming into his home at 10:00 pm when the unnamed officer opened his door.
 While the details surrounding how Jean was killed are unclear, according to police, the officer admitted to killing him.
 In a statement released on Friday, Dallas police said their officer called them after shooting Jean and told responding officers that “she entered the victim’s apartment believing that it was her own.”

 On September 6, 2018 at about 9:59 p.m., an off duty Dallas Police officer called police dispatch and said she was involved in a shooting at the apartments located at 1210 S. Lamar.
 Preliminary information suggests that the officer arrived home in full uniform after working a full shift.
 The officer reported to the responding officers that she entered the victim’s apartment believing that it was her own.
 At some point, the officer fired her weapon striking the victim.
 Responding officers administered aid to the victim, a 26-year-old male, at the scene.
 The victim was then transported to the hospital and pronounced deceased.
 Next of kin notification has not been made at this time.
 The officer was not injured and will be placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation.
 The Dallas Police Department is conducting a joint investigation with the District Attorney’s Office.
 This investigation is ongoing and we will release additional details as they become available and it is appropriate to do so.
 If an average citizen walked into the wrong home and shot and killed an innocent homeowner, rest assured that they would be in jail—right now.
 However, instead of immediately arresting the officer for trespassing and murder, she was simply placed on administrative leave—a glaring function of blue privilege indeed.
 “Super scary because the police are supposed to protect you and then they come home and, you know, you’re just hanging out in your own house and then they come home thinking they’re home or whatever.
 I don’t know if she was tired but that’s pretty scary,” Richard Healy Nelson, who lives in the complex, said to reporters.
 NBC News spoke with Jean’s mother in a phone interview from her home in St. Lucia who was stunned to hear of his death.
 “He did no one any wrong,” she said.
 While the Free Thought Project consistently reports on police officers entering the wrong home during raids and killing, maiming, or traumatizing entirely innocent people, this is the first time we’ve reported a story of an off-duty cop going into the wrong home, on their way home, and killing someone.
 The details of how or why this officer would walk into an apartment that was not hers are unclear.
 However, what is entirely clear is the fact that a mother and father are now and will be grieving for the rest of their lives because of her actions.
 And, in a slap to the face of Jean’s parents, the person who admitted to killing their innocent son has yet to be arrested.

"Dallas Police Officer Finally Arrested After Entering Wrong Apartment & Killing Man
 
 Last week, it was reported that Dallas Police Officer Amber Guyger entered an apartment she claims that she thought was hers and subsequently found the occupant of that apartment home and shot and killed him, claiming she thought he was an intruder.
 Now, after several days of outcry from the community, Guyger has been arrested and Charged with manslaughter in the death of 26-year-old Botham Jean.
 In a statement released on Friday, Dallas police said their officer called them after shooting Jean and told responding officers that “she entered the victim’s apartment believing that it was her own.”

 I have no idea how you can enter an apartment mistakenly.
 Does Guyger leave her door unlocked?
 Furthermore, The Dallas News reports:
 Jean, who lived on the fourth floor of the South Side Flats in the Cedars, was home alone when Guyger mistook his apartment for hers, the affidavit says.
 Guyger lived on the third floor, directly beneath his apartment, and mistakenly parked on the fourth floor after finishing a shift at the Dallas Police Department, the affidavit says.
 When she arrived at Jean's door, Guyger entered a unique door key with an electronic chip into the keyhole, the affidavit says.
 The door was already ajar, so the force of pushing the key inside opened the door, according to the affidavit.
 The affidavit says the apartments' ""respective interior floorplans are in most ways identical or extremely similar.""
 The apartment was dark and when she saw ""a large silhouette,"" Guyger thought she was being burglarized, the affidavit says.
 The affidavit says Guyger drew her gun, ""gave verbal commands that were ignored"" and fired twice.
 Jean was struck once in the torso.
 Guyger then called 911 from her cellphone and started performing first aid.
 She turned on the lights, then went to the front door again and realized the apartment wasn't hers, the affidavit says.
 She told the 911 operator as well as responding officers that she thought she was at her apartment when she shot Jean, according to the affidavit.
 Ok, some of this seems plausible, but I still am left wondering about the door being ajar.
 Is this something people are prone to do at 1o o'clock at night in Dallas?
 In any case, we all know that any of us who did the same thing would have immediately been taken into custody.
 This was not the case with Guyger, though one officer close to her said, ""she is devastated.""
 Knowing this provoked outrage across the nation over the weekend.
 In fact, this is not her first shooting.
 As a four-year veteran of the force, she was also involved in the shooting of another suspect in 2017.
 The Dallas News reported:
 In 2017, Guyger shot 47-year-old Uvaldo Perez, who had wrestled a Taser away from her.
 Another officer had been in a Pleasant Grove neighborhood looking for a woman who had a warrant out for her arrest.
 When the officer thought he saw the woman in a car with two men in the 8300 block of Reva Street, the officer asked for backup from Guyger and another officer, according to an affidavit.
 One of the officers was trying to search Perez when he became combative, the affidavit said.
 Guyger deployed her Taser before Perez was able to take it from her.
 After Perez had the Taser, Guyger fired her gun once, striking him in the abdomen, the affidavit said.
 Neither Guyger nor the other officers were injured in the 2017 shooting.
 Police arrested Perez on a charge of taking a weapon from an officer, as well as charges for possession of methamphetamine, marijuana and violating his parole.
 In February 2018, Perez signed a plea agreement for the charge of taking an officer's weapon and was sentenced to two years in prison.
 The Texas Rangers are also involved in the investigation.
 USA Today reports that Guyger was freed on bail on Sunday after being charged with manslaughter, and faces two 20-year sentences and up to a $10,000 fine.
 A charge of murder may be forthcoming once the case is taken to a grand jury, according to Dallas County District Attorney Faith Johnson.

"Dallas Police Attempt to ‘Smear’ Botham Jean Over Tiny Bit of Weed and they Failed, Miserably
 
 Dallas, TX — The Dallas Police on Thursday announced the findings of a search warrant they executed on the home of Botham Jean after he was gunned down in his apartment by one of their own.
 The department is now accused of trying to “smear” Jean by claiming they found a tiny bit of marijuana in his house—as if this justifies going into someone’s home and murdering them.
 The timing couldn’t have been more insidiously planned as police released the affidavit on the day of Jean’s funeral—despite having allegedly found the marijuana last week.
 According to the affidavit, when they searched his home, police claimed to have found 10.4 grams of pot—less than half an ounce.
 Police also said they found two fired cartridge casings, a police backpack and vest, and a metal marijuana grinder—the horror.
 Even if police did find marijuana, why on earth would they execute a search warrant on an innocent dead man’s home and then release that information to the public?

 “They [police] immediately began looking to smear him,” attorney Lee Merritt said.
 “I think it’s unfortunate that law enforcement begin to immediately criminalize the victim—in this case, someone who was clearly was the victim that has absolutely no bearing on the fact that he was shot in his home,” Merritt added to Fox 4.
 Pointing out the glaring nature of the smear campaign was the fact that there has been absolutely zero information released about the warrants conducted on officer Amber Guyger, the killer cop who lived just below Jean.
 “I would love to see more information coming out about the warrants executed on the home of the shooter who lived just below him.
 I haven’t seen any of those,” said Merritt.
 Merritt accused the department of conducting a “common assassination attempt on the victim that we often see in law enforcement involved shootings.” Sadly, he appears to be correct in his accusations.
 It is standard procedure for police to dig up dirt on their victims in attempts to smear and assassinate their character to make the killer cops look good in the public eye.
 Even sadder, however, is the fact that these smear campaigns work most of the time.
 As the Free Thought Project reported on Wednesday, according to police — who continue to attempt to spin this story into some tragic mistake — Guyger accidentally went into the wrong apartment, mistook Jean for an intruder and killed him.
 “Guyger entered the building and walked down the fourth-floor hallway to what she thought was her apartment,” according to the arrest warrant made public Monday afternoon.
 “She inserted a unique door key, with an electronic chip, into the door keyhole.
 The door, which was slightly ajar prior to Guyger’s arrival, fully opened under the force of the key insertion.”
 “Guyger drew her firearm, gave verbal commands that were ignored by … Jean,” according to the warrant.
 “Guyger fired her handgun two times striking [Jean] in the torso.
 Guyger entered the apartment, immediately called 911, requesting police and EMS, and provided first aid to … Jean.
 “Due to the interior darkness of the apartment, Guyger turned on the interior lights while on the phone with 911.
 Upon being asked where she was located by emergency dispatchers, Guyger returned to the front door to observe the address and discovered she was at the wrong apartment,” according to the arrest warrant.
 At no time, according to the warrant, does Guyger say what “verbal commands” she gave.
 What’s more, any verbal commands she did give were entirely irrelevant as she was the intruder—not Jean.
 Attempting to imply that Jean was somehow at fault for his own death for disobeying the commands of a homicidal cop who’d just illegally broken into his home is as irresponsible as it is reprehensible.
 What’s more, according to the attorneys for Jean, when Guyger was on the phone with police, she had to go outside to verify the address of the apartment—implying that she knew she was in the wrong apartment from the start.
 “From the fact that when you look at an affidavit and I’m thinking that I’m at my house and I call 911 because someone was just shot,” Attorney Daryl Washington said.
 “Well, the very first thing that I’m going to do is I’m not going to go outside and look at my address?
 I’m going to give them my address right there on the phone.
 I’m going to say I’m on the phone.
 My address is this.
 Why did she have to go outside to verify the address?
 It makes no sense whatsoever.”
 Even more ominous than having to verify the address is the fact that according to witnesses, Guyger’s story of inserting the key into Jean’s door and it opening up was simply not true.
 According to witnesses, Guyger was banging on Jean’s door, demanding he let her in.
 “Independent witnesses have already come forward to say that they heard this officer pounding on the door and demanding to be let in,” Lee Merritt, one of the attorneys representing the Jean family, told ABC News.
 “The contradictions begin to build from there.”
 The doors in the complex are also equipped with an automatic closing mechanism.
 This was demonstrated by the attorneys who opened the door and released it several times—showing that it closed every single time—blowing the claim that the door was somehow ajar completely out of the water.
 Jean’s family also pointed out that it would have been incredibly unlikely for Guyger to mistake Jean’s apartment for her own as he had a distinct red door mat which would have been enough for the cop to know she was at the wrong place.

 Even as cops come to Guyger’s defense and attempt to shame, smear, and discredit her victim—who was an upstanding member of society regardless of the plant they claim to have found—they are failing miserably.
 Despite cops rallying behind the blue line to defend this killer cop, the rest of the country is not buying it.
 In a damning tweet, writer Kashana Cauley summed up the nature of the smear campaign quite succinctly.
 In response to cops claiming to find a tiny bit of weed, she pointed out that there was also a homicidal cop inside too.
 His apartment also contained an off duty homicidal cop.

 “Federal Judge Denies New Mexico Compound Residents Bail,” by Vanessa Romo, KRWG, September 13, 2018:
 A federal judge denied bail on Wednesday to all five members of an extended family accused of operating a training camp for a violent attack on public institutions out of their isolated New Mexico compound.
 During the arraignment hearing, Magistrate Judge Kirtan Khalsa told the defendants there was “clear and convincing evidence that you are a danger to the community,” The Associated Press reported.
 A federal grand jury indicted the group on Tuesday on conspiracy and federal firearms charges stemming from the discovery of a cache of weapons after law enforcement raided their home in search of a missing boy but, instead, found 11 malnourished children living in squalid conditions.
 Federal prosecutors say that between Dec. 2017 and August 2018, the group, who are either siblings or related by marriage, had “a common plan to prepare for violent attacks on government, military, educational and financial institutions.” U.S. Attorney John C. Anderson and Special Agent in Charge James C. Langenberg of the FBI’s Albuquerque Division, said in a statement that the defendants’ home in Amalia, N.M., served as a firing range and training camp to carry out an attack as part of a religious prophecy.
 According to the indictment, some of the minors were being prepared “to engage in jihad and … to die as martyrs.”… Siraj Ibn Wahhaj’s lawyer in the state case, suggested that those charges were motivated by a degree of racial and religious prejudice against his Muslim client.
 If the suspects were white Christians shooting guns on their property and practicing their religion, “No one would bat an eye,” Thomas Clark argued in court.
 “If these were white people of a Christian faith who owned guns, that’s not a big deal because there’s a Second Amendment right to own firearms in this country.
 If these were white Christians, faith healing is of no consequence because we have freedom of religion in this country.
 But they look different and they worship differently from the rest of us,” Clark said….
 Last month, two state judges were forced to dismiss child neglect charges against all five adults when the local district attorney’s office missed a 10-day deadline to present initial evidence of crime.
 A few days later, Taos-based District Attorney Donald Gallegos dropped charges related to the death of Siraj Wahhaj’s son, “saying he was seeking more time to assemble and analyze evidence, and that he intended to seek grand jury indictment,” The Durango Herald reported.

"Warrants Show Police Never Searched Amber Guyger’s Apartment, Now It’s Too Late, She’s ‘Vacated’ It
 
 Dallas, TX — On Sunday, activists rallied around the Dallas Cowboy’s stadium to draw attention to the slaying of Botham Jean.
 They carried coffins and blocked traffic to expose the special treatment of Amber Guyger, the cop who has yet to even be fired for killing Jean.
 Now, as more details emerge, this special treatment has moved to a level that is even more insidious.

 From the beginning of this case, it was clear that Guyger was receiving special treatment from law enforcement.
 One of the most glaring instances showing her privilege was the fact that the Texas Rangers said in their report that Jean refused to obey Guyger’s “verbal commands.” Had anyone else but a cop walked into an apartment and killed an innocent man, do you believe that investigators would have said anything like this?
 Attorney Stephen Le Brocq, who operates a law firm in the North Texas area sums up the treatment of Guyger perfectly when he says that “The affidavit isn’t written objectively, not at the slightest.
 As stated before, they are usually wholly against the accused.
 An objective view of the information related by the officer would be proper, in my opinion.
 This affidavit states facts based upon the word of the person it seeks to accuse of criminal wrongdoing.”
 What’s more, according to WFAA, who obtained affidavits for all of the search warrants involved in the case, none of them involved the search of Guyger’s apartment.
 For those who don’t recall, police egregiously released the search warrant findings of Jean’s apartment on the day his family buried his dead body.
 They attempted to assassinate Jean’s character by claiming they found less than a half ounce of weed in his apartment.
 However, they failed miserably at it.
 One thing in particular, however, stood out to those paying attention and that is the fact the police didn’t release any information on what they found in Guyger’s apartment.
 According to the information currently available, that’s because they didn’t search it.
 According to WFAA, there were five search warrants issued in the case—none of which were for the killer’s apartment.
 As WFAA reports:
 Two of the warrants allowed investigators to remove the front door of Guyger and Jean’s apartment, their door locks and to download data for their door locks.
 An inventory return states that they removed both of their door lock and downloaded the data from the door locks.
 A third search warrant gave investigators the authority to enter Jean’s apartment and collect additional evidence.
 A return shows that investigators took photographs of his apartment, made videos of his apartment, conducted “laser measurements of firearm trajectory,” and collected “gunshot residue” from the door frame and kitchen wall of Jean’s apartment.
 A return for the fourth search warrant shows investigators seized video from the surveillance camera system in the apartment management’s office.
 A fifth search warrant gave investigators the authority to obtain all communications related to the incident in the possession of property management, as well as all surveillance video and all entry and access logs from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. on the night of the shooting.
 An inventory return shows investigators seized a USB drive containing the video, an event log report for “linear access doors and gates,” an “elevator access door lock” report and a “lock audit report for both apartments.
 Now, even if police would try to search the killer cop’s apartment, it’s too late.
 On Sunday, apartment staff notified residents in an email that Guyger “has vacated her apartment and no longer resides at our community.”
 A manager at the complex declined to indicate exactly when Guyger moved out and if she left the premises voluntarily, the Dallas Morning News reports.
 While residents can certainly sleep better knowing that they don’t have to fear a killer cop walking into their apartment and murdering them, the family of Botham Jean likely sees this as one more instance of injustice.
 Mother of #BothamJean, Allison Jean, says the “smear” of her son is unacceptable.

"Are You Kidding Me, Ted Cruz?
 Don't ""Blame The Police Officer"" Who Admitted Killing Botham Jean?
 
 Dallas, TX — In a repugnant and outright disrespectful move, Texas Senator Ted Cruz went to bat for Amber Guyger, the cop who admitted to taking the life of the innocent 26-year-old pillar of society, Botham Jean.
 During an interview over the weekend, Cruz sat down with FOX 26 who started with the question of what he thought about the tragic killing of Jean by Guyger.
 FOX 26 asked Cruz to respond to his Democratic midterm rival, Beto O’Rourke, who called for officer Guyger to be fired.
 “I think we are all counting on the district attorney, on those in positions of trust and power right now, to do the right thing,” O’Rourke said, implying that, at the very minimum, Amber Guyger should be fired.
 “There has to be a full accounting for how young black men continue to be killed in this country without accountability, without justice, without these full investigations, without respecting their civil rights.
 This cannot continue.”

 In response, Cruz lashed out at O’Rourke, claiming that he is being too quick to judge.
 “I wish Beto O’Rourke & Democrats weren’t so quick to always blame the police officer,” Cruz said Saturday during an interview with Houston’s KRIV.
 “She may have been in the wrong … but I don’t think we should jump to conclusions.”

 ... She may have been in the wrong ... but I don’t think we should jump to conclusions"" amid investigation https://t.co/68nHBodrOM — Patrick Svitek (@PatrickSvitek) September 17, 2018
 Cruz then went on to call the situation a tragedy and said that if a jury of her peers finds she did something wrong then Guyger should suffer the consequences.
 To be clear, Amber Guyger admitted to doing something wrong.
 While controversy swarms the case of why she may have killed Jean, there is no doubt that she did kill him.
 This is a fact.
 This public servant walked into an innocent man’s home and shot him dead.
 Because of her actions, this man no longer lives.
 That, Senator Ted Cruz, is wrong.
 Mistake or not, she killed an innocent man.
 She is the only one to blame and yet she is still collecting a paycheck from taxpayers.
 Calling for Gugyer to be fired is not the same as calling for people to be fired for making stupid Instagram posts or saying stupid things—she killed an innocent man.
 At the very least, she should be fired from her job which gave her the gun to do it.
 What Ted Cruz is doing is the same thing the police and their apologists are doing.
 They are treating Guyger differently because she is part of the system.
 In Cruz’s eyes, Guyger going into an apartment that wasn’t her’s and killing an innocent man was simply a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time—a tragic mistake that ruined two lives, according to Cruz.
 But that is not the case at all.
 Would Ted Cruz and police officers be following this same narrative if the roles were reversed?
 If it was Botham Jean, a black man, walking into the apartment of Amber Guyger, a white female cop, and killing her—would police and Ted Cruz simply write it off as a tragic accident?
 Of course, we know the answer to that question and it is a resounding, NO.
 To shut down the peanut gallery before it begins, this is not some case of Democrat versus Republican or right versus left.
 This is a case of right versus wrong, and what Amber Guyger did to Botham Jean was wrong.
 There is no other way around it, “mistake” or not.
 From the start of this case, law enforcement have set out to protect Guyger because she is part of their blue line.
 Amber Guyger’s home was never searched while Jean’s apartment was searched that night.
 The results of the blood test to test for alcohol or drugs in her system were never released, yet police — on the day his mother buried her son — claimed they found marijuana in his house.
 It’s been a smear campaign from the beginning and it is this way by design.
 Amber Guyger took an innocent person’s life, and because people are so blinded by the badge, she is being portrayed as the victim.
 To those who attempt to claim there is no bias in this horrifically flawed system, if ever there was a case to prove you wrong—this is it.
 A tragedy indeed.

"Keith Ellison Domestic Violence Accuser: Democratic Party Doesn’t Believe My Story
 
 Karen Monahan, the woman who accused Keith Ellison of domestic abuse, says Democrats don’t believe her and are turning a blind eye and ear toward her claims — yet curiously, finding time and cause to go after Brett Kavanaugh.
 Democrats, they do pick their “victims” well, don’t they?

 Monahan is Ellison’s former girlfriend, and she came forward a month ago to say the Democrat, now seeking an attorney general’s slot in Minnesota, sent her threatening text messages and physically hurt her in one of their confrontations.
 Yet Democrats don’t think his accuser meets the same threshhold as Kavanaugh’s accuser?
 Apparently.
 More, from Fox News:
 The woman who accused Minnesota Democratic Rep. Keith Ellison of domestic abuse said on Monday that Democrats don’t believe her story and threatened to isolate her over the allegations.
 Karen Monahan, a former girlfriend, came forward last month alleging that Ellison sent her threatening text messages and once screamed obscenities at her as he dragged her off a bed by her feet.
 Ellison has denied the accusations, saying he “never behaved this way.” He did acknowledge he was in a relationship with the woman.
 The allegations didn’t lead to any immediate action against the congressman, except for the announcement that the Democratic National Committee (DNC) would review the accusations.
 He went on to win the Democratic primary election for Minnesota attorney general.
 Monahan slammed the Democratic Party for its response to her allegations when compared to its treatment of Christine Blasey Ford.
 Ford has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of attempting to force himself onto her during at a high school party nearly four decades ago, prompting prominent Democrats to get behind Ford’s allegations.
 “No, they don’t,” Monahan tweeted in response to a question whether the party believes women’s stories.
 “I’ve been smeared, threatened, isolated from my own party.
 I provided medical records from 2017, stating on two different Dr.
 Visits, I told them about the abuse and who did it.
 My therapist released records stating I have been dealing and healing from the abuse.” She added: “Four people, including my supervisor at the time, stated that I came to them after and shared the exact story I shared publicly, I shared multiple text between me and Keith, where I discuss the abuse with him and much more.
 As I said before, I knew I wouldn’t be believed.” Her comment came after another user pointed to comments made by Peter Daou, a Democratic strategist and former advisor to Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, who wrote in a tweet that the Kavanaugh accuser will be “attacked, smeared, and demonized” and that people must “believe women.” Many other Democrats and progressives – who stayed silent when the accusations against Ellison emerged – came out in support of Ford, including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Tom Perez, chairman of the DNC, who urged to investigate the claims and Kavanaugh.
 Monahan went to reiterate that her story has nothing to do with politics.
 “I have nothing to prove to anyone, I simply shared my story.
 People can believe it or not.
 I don’t need anyone to affirm my humanity, I affirmed it,” she wrote in another tweet.
 “The fact that both parties only care if it scores political points is hypocritical,” she added.
 “Do you think a person who has dealt with any form of abuse by politicians is thinking about politics?
 No, we & are families are trying to heal.”

"‘Emotional And Physical Abuse’: Muslim Brotherhood DNC Deputy Chair Ellison Accuser Posts Doctor’s Report Naming Him As Alleged Abuser
 
 There is abundant evidence that Karen Monahan is telling the truth when she says that Muslim Brotherhood Congressman Hakim Muhammad, aka Keith Ellison, abused her.
 By contrast, there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever that Brett Kavanaugh abused Christine Blasey Ford.
 But while the Democrats are in a lather over Ford and Kavanaugh, demanding a delay of the confirmation vote until after the midterm elections that they are sure will go their way, they couldn’t care less about Karen Monahan.
 And that shows that all their #MeToo rhetoric is pure politically-motivated hypocrisy — as if anyone didn’t know that by now.
 “‘Emotional And Physical Abuse’: Ellison Accuser Posts Doctor’s Report Naming Congressman As Alleged Abuser,” by Peter Hasson, Daily Caller, September 19, 2018 (thanks to Christian):
 The ex-girlfriend accusing Democratic Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison of domestic abuse told her doctor in 2017 about alleged “emotional and physical abuse” from Ellison, according to a document the woman published Wednesday.

 Karen Monahan’s account in the doctor’s report is consistent with what she has been saying publicly since August: that Ellison was emotionally and physically abusive to her while the two were dating.
 Ellison is the deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and is the Democratic nominee for Minnesota attorney general.
 He has adamantly denied emotionally or physically abusing Monahan.
 “She states that she was in a very stressful environment for years, emotional and physical abuse by a partner with whom she is now separated,” reads the November 2017 report, a picture of which Monahan posted on Twitter.
 “She did not have any physical injuries that required an examination in the past.
 She identifies the individual she was involved with as congressman Ellison, and she is worried about retribution if she identifies him publicly,” the report states.
 Ellison’s congressional office did not immediately return a request for comment.
 The Democratic Party has maintained its support for Ellison’s attorney general campaign despite the allegations.
 DNC Chair Tom Perez previously said the committee was “reviewing” the allegations.
 Perez later deferred to an investigation by the party’s Minnesota arm, the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL), which endorsed Ellison’s campaign in spite of Monahan’s allegations.
 Monahan wrote Wednesday that Ellison declined any meeting with her as part of the investigation.
 “I told the investigator I would be happy to talk with @keithellison [with] them in the room.
 They asked Keith if he would be willing [and] he declined any meeting [with] me,” she wrote….

"Dallas Chief Says She Can’t Fire Amber Guyger for Killing Botham Jean - Dept Rules Imply Otherwise
 
 Dallas, TX — As citizens call for justice in the case of Dallas police officer Amber Guyger — the cop who killed the innocent Botham Jean in his own home — the controversy continues to grow.
 In a town hall meeting this week, citizens showed that they still have a lot of questions for the Dallas Police Department in regards to the cold-blooded killing of Botham Jean.
 On top of questions as to why it took several days to arrest the cop — despite the fact that Guyger admitted to it — were questions like why this person who has proven to be a threat to society has yet to be fired from the police force.
 During the meeting, as Chief Renee Hall dodged several questions over the details of the arrest, she did go out of her way to answer the question of why Guyger is still collecting a paycheck from their department.
 The short of it, according to Hall, is she can’t fire her.

 “I can’t do that because there are both local, state and federal laws that prohibit me from taking action.
 There are civil service laws we have to adhere to,” said Hall.
 But experts say this is not true.
 As WFAA reports, Justin Moore, a civil rights attorney was a panelist at the meeting and was surprised by the Chief’s comments.
 “I was completely mystified, and I really didn’t understand where it came from last night.
 It seemed like Chief Hall might not have been well informed on the law,” said Moore.
 WFAA went further and noted that the “the Dallas Police Department general orders do allow the chief to take action, saying, ‘The Chief of Police may circumvent all formal disciplinary procedures to render an immediate decision when it deems it necessary to preserve the integrity of the department.’”
 Apparently, this “integrity” is not worth preserving and the Dallas police are going out of their way to keep a killer cop on their payroll.
 As WFAA pointed out, lots of cops across the state who have been under criminal investigation have been fired by police chiefs.
 This includes cops within the Dallas police department.
 Amy Wilburn, a former Dallas cop shot an unarmed teen in the stomach as he sat down with his hands in the air in 2013.
 Days later, after her account was found to be entirely false, she was fired for it.
 Wilburn became the first cop in 41 years — since officer Darrell Cain murdered a 12-year-old boy in the back of his squad car — to be indicted for shooting a suspect.
 Also in 2013, officer Cardan Spencer shot a mentally ill man in his driveway.
 Days later, he was also fired after surveillance video proved he was lying about what happened.
 So why hasn’t the chief fired Gugyer, who has actually been charged, arrested, and admitted to killing an innocent man?
 Like all those accused of a crime, Amber Guyger deserves her day in court.
 However, as far as her job with the department is concerned, she has already proven that she is no longer fit for duty, ever again.
 WFAA asked the Dallas Police Department for the laws she cited claiming that she can’t fire Guyger, but they did not provide them.
 The department did respond about the general order mentioned by WFAA, however, saying, “General order 508 refers to the Police Chief’s ability to circumvent the formal disciplinary procedures not the investigative process.”
 Exactly what “investigative process” needs to happen before they can fire her remains unclear as this public servant admitted to killing an innocent man in his own home.
 At the very least, she should be fired for this.
 But then again, as we’ve reported already this week, Amber Guyger is subject to a different set of rules than common citizens, which apparently includes keeping a paycheck after admitting to killing an unarmed, innocent, pillar of society, Botham Jean.

"Blue Privilege: Amber Guyger Free on Bail as Activists Who Peacefully Protested Her Rot in Jail
 
 The case of Amber Guyger, the police officer who admitted to shooting 26-year-old Botham Jean in his apartment for no reason, is a glaring example of “blue privilege” at work in our society.
 Guyger claims that she accidentally entered the wrong apartment and shot a man who she thought was a burglar, however, eyewitness testimony has contradicted her initial statement.
 Despite admitting to killing an innocent man and having her initial statement contradicted by witness testimony, Guyger has been treated as more of a victim than a killer.
 In fact, Guyger’s apartment was never even searched for evidence, and she was allowed to “vacate” the premises without any type of search.
 By not searching her apartment immediately, police ruined the investigation, making it harder to prosecute her.
 It would be reasonable to assume that these steps were taken intentionally because they want to see her get away with it.

 Meanwhile, Botham Jean, the actual victim, had his house searched immediately.
 Police claim to have found a very small amount of marijuana, which they attempted to use to smear his name and somehow justify the killing.
 It is obvious in this case that Guyger is receiving special treatment, not only did she get away without a search, but she turned herself in at her own convenience and was let out two hours later.
 Not even the richest people in the country with the best lawyers would receive this type of treatment if they just admitted to killing an innocent person.
 There has also been controversy over the fact that Guyger has been charged with manslaughter instead of murder, which will make it possible for her to receive a much short prison sentence.
 As Guyger walks free awaiting her trial, the 9 people who were arrested protesting the murder and Guyger’s special treatment are still sitting behind bars.
 After a ceremony for Botham Jean, the protesters were arrested for obstructing traffic.
 Attorney Lee Merritt, who represents Botham Jean’s family, posted an update about the injustice on Twitter.
 I just learned the Dallas 9 will spend another night in jail for peacefully protesting brutality.
 Tues Officer Wiley will be tried for shooting an unarmed man 2x he wrongfully suspected of burglarizing his own car.
 D-9 have already spent more time in jail then he ever has.
 pic.twitter.com/mGHOzsN6Pp — S. Lee Merritt, Esq.
 (@MeritLaw) September 17, 2018
 “The officer responsible for the completely unjustifiable shooting death of O’Shea Terry has been returned to light duty and has faced no criminal charges whatsoever.
 The officer who shot and killed Botham Jean remains on the Dallas police force and was able to bond out on manslaughter charges in a fraction of the time the protestors have spent in jail,” Merritt said in a statement.
 Merrit cast suspicion on the police for intentionally keeping these protestors in jail to send a message and make an example out of them.
 The reaction from the police, in this case, has shown that they believe they have a license to kill and that they cannot be trusted to monitor themselves and keep one another in check.
 They have no interest in serving justice when it comes to enforcing crimes against their own.

"Cop Killer Supporter Keith Ellison Calls Cops To Protect Him From Female Journalist Armed With Mic & Camera Phone
 
 Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN) is the epitome of an effeminate man today in America.
 He stands accused by two women who claim that he not only verbally abused them, but physically assaulted them as well, and no, these women didn't wait decades or even till there was a politically opportune time to voice their accusations.
 One even had reported him to the police.
 Investigative journalist Laura Loomer was informed by police in Minnesota that he wanted police protection from her when he found out she was attending the education forum that was held Saturday.
 This is a man who follows a demonic religion, Islam, and supports cop killers.
 He does all of this while he stands accused of abusing women and running to be attorney general in Minnesota, even though he possesses no attorney's license that is valid.
 Here's Loomer's tweet from Sunday with video of her speaking to a policeman about it.

 “An Officer in Minnesota informed me that Keith Ellison’s campaign contacted Apple Valley Police in MN & told them he wanted police protection from me when he found out I was attending the education forum that was held yesterday,” Loomer wrote.
 SCOOP: An Officer in Minnesota informed me that Keith Ellison’s campaign contacted Apple Valley Police in MN & told them he wanted police protection from me when he found out I was attending the education forum that was held yesterday.
 THAT IS WHY the police were there.
 👇🏻 pic.twitter.com/ABIvsJNW4d — Laura Loomer (@LauraLoomer) September 23, 2018
 On Saturday, there was an education panel at the Education Minnesota Apple Valley open to union members and guests.
 Prior to the event, Ellison's campaign called police to ensure that he was ""protected"" from a woman armed with a mic and camera phone .
 Loomer peppered him with questions about the alleged abuse at a State Attorney General debate Friday night.
 She stood alongside other female survivors of abuse.
 Ellison not only claimed the women were lying but then fled the scene.
 At least he said something there, which is more than I can say for his response earlier in September when Loomer confronted him at another event with questions.
 Failing to answer, Ellison tried to move from person to person, allowing his minions to try and provide cover for him, similar to that of Maxine Waters, but there was no ""member's only"" elevator to flee into.
 Finally, Ellison fled the scene, hounding by Loomer and others questioning him about the abuse.
 The irony is of Ellison's campaign calling on the police to protect him from a woman, armed with a mic and camera phone, who is simply asking him to respond to the accusations and police report, as well as how he plans on being attorney general without a license, when he has shown his support for those that murder police officers in cold blood.
 Scott Johnson reports on Ellison's sordid history supporting such criminals.
 Ellison was an active supporter and local leader of the Nation of Islam in Minneapolis before his election to Congress.
 (I set forth this history in some detail in the October 9, 2006 issue of The Weekly Standard.)
 Ellison has baldly dissembled about this history since 2006.
 In his 2014 memoir My Country, ’Tis of Thee ,for example, Ellison simply omitted it and presented himself as a critic of Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam.
 This past June, Ellison told Jake Tapper on CNN, “I worked on the Million Man March and I was proud to do so.
 That’s it.” But that wasn’t it.
 Ellison first sought office as a Democrat in 1998 as Keith Ellison-Muhammad, a self-avowed member of the Nation of Islam.
 (Ellison-Muhammad is just one of three Nation of Islam names Ellison has used over the years.)
 Fortunately for him, Ellison’s 5th District constituents haven’t much cared about his history and the Minneapolis Star Tribune has almost entirely let it rest exactly where Ellison wants it.
 But seeking the top law enforcement job in Minnesota and running for statewide office should be a more daunting challenge because Ellison is an extraordinarily poor fit for the job.
 Among the troubling threads that run through Ellison’s career: support for cop killers.
 In September 1992 Minneapolis police officer Jerry Haaf was murdered execution-style, shot in the back as he took a coffee break at a restaurant in south Minneapolis.
 Police later determined that Haaf’s murder was a gang hit performed by four members of the city’s Vice Lords gang.The leader of the Vice Lords was Sharif Willis, a convicted murderer who had been released from prison and who sought respectability as a responsible gang leader from gullible municipal authorities while operating a gang front called United for Peace.
 The four Vice Lords members who murdered Haaf met and planned the murder at Willis’s house.
 Despite the fact that two witnesses implicated Willis in the planning he was never charged because law enforcement authorities said they lacked sufficient evidence to convict him.
 At the time, Ellison was a Minneapolis attorney in private practice.
 And within a month of Haaf’s murder, Ellison appeared with Willis supporting the United for Peace gang front.
 In October 1992, Ellison helped organize a demonstration against Minneapolis police that included United for Peace.
 “The main point of our rally is to support United for Peace [in its fight against] the campaign of slander the police federation has been waging,” said Ellison.
 Willis was the last speaker at the demonstration.
 According to a contemporaneous report in the St. Paul Pioneer Press, Willis told the crowd that Minneapolis police were experiencing the same fear from young black men that blacks had felt from police for many years.
 “If the police have some fear, I understand that fear,” Willis said.
 “We seem to have an overabundance of bad police.
 .
 .
 .
 [W]e’re going to get rid of them,” Willis said.
 “They’ve got to go.” The Pioneer Press account concludes with Ellison’s contribution to the demonstration: “Ellison told the crowd that the police union is systematically frightening whites in order to get more police officers hired.
 That way, Ellison said, the union can increase its power base.” Ellison publicly supported the Haaf murder defendants.
 In February 1993, he spoke at a demonstration for one of them during his trial.
 Ellison led the crowd assembled at the courthouse in a chant that was ominous in the context of Haaf’s cold-blooded murder: “We don’t get no justice, you don’t get no peace.” Ellison’s working relationship with Sharif Willis finally came to an end in February 1995, when Willis was convicted in federal court on several counts of drug and gun-related crimes and sent back to prison for 20 years.
 The Haaf case wasn’t an aberration for Ellison.
 In February 2000, he spoke at a fundraiser sponsored by the Minnesota chapter of the old National Lawyers Guild, on whose steering committee he had served—the chapter was raising funds for former Symbionese Liberation Army member Kathleen Soliah, who had been a fugitive from justice for 25 years, on charges related to the attempted pipe bombing of Los Angeles police officers in 1975.
 (The National Lawyers Guild is an old Communist front group that somehow survived the fall of the Soviet Union.
 Regimes come and go; dupes are forever.)
 In his National Lawyers Guild speech Ellison spoke favorably of cop killers Mumia Abu-Jamal and “Assata Shakur” (Joanne Chesimard), who was wanted for the murder of New Jersey state trooper Werner Foerster in 1973.
 Chesimard was convicted of that murder but escaped from prison in 1979 and has been on the lam in Cuba since 1984.
 Bryan Burrough’s Days of Rage has a riveting account of Chesimard’s terrorist career.
 In 2013, the FBI made Chesimard the first woman named to its Most Wanted Terrorists List.
 The FBI has offered a reward of up to $1,000,000 for her capture.
 Yet Ellison prayed for Chesimard in his National Lawyers Guild speech: “I am praying that Castro does not get to the point where he has to really barter with these guys over here because they’re going to get Assata Shakur, they’re going to get a whole lot of other people,” he told the crowd.
 “I hope the Cuba[n] people can stick to it, because the freedom of some good decent people depends on it.” Ellison’s support for Soliah/Olson in the speech is equally notable.
 He denounced law enforcement authorities for prosecuting the attempted murder of police officers.
 Referring to the days Soliah/Olson had spent in the SLA under the leadership of Donald DeFreeze (“Field Marshal Cinque”), Ellison hailed Soliah/Olson as a “black gang member” and portrayed her as a victim of government persecution.
 He described her as one of those who had been “fighting for freedom in the ‘60s and’70s” and called for her release.
 Ellison to the contrary notwithstanding, Soliah/Olson pleaded guilty to the crimes charged in Los Angeles and to an additional murder charge in Sacramento.
 According to Ellison, Soliah/Olson was a social justice warrior fighting the good fight.
 The case had nothing to do with the attempted murder of police officers; that was but a pretext.
 Seems he is more than willing to use the police to shield him from the press who will confront him publicly while taking the side of their murderers for political gain.
 Shame on you, Hakim Muhammad!

"Citing ‘Adverse Conduct’ Police Finally Fire Amber Guyger for Killing Botham Jean
 
 Dallas, TX — After the Dallas police department refused to fire an officer who admitted to killing an innocent man, outrage erupted, and rightfully so.
 Now, however, on Monday, the department announced that officer Amber Guyger has finally been fired.
 On Monday, the Dallas police department announced that the officer who admitted to walking into the apartment of 26-year-old Botham Jean and killing him was finally fired.
 “Dallas Police Chief U. Renee Hall terminated Police Officer Amber Guyger, #10702, during a hearing held September 24, 2018,” the statement read.
 “An Internal Affairs investigation concluded that on September 9, 2018, Officer Guyger, #10702, engaged in adverse conduct when she was arrested for Manslaughter.”

 The department then went on to note that Guyger could appeal this firing under their civil service rules.
 Officer Guyger was terminated for her actions.
 She was hired in November 2013 and was assigned to the Southeast Patrol Division.
 Under civil service rules, Officer Guyger has the right to appeal her discipline.
 This move is noteworthy as the department has been standing up against those who have been calling for the officer to be fired.
 As recently as Friday, Hall refused to fire Guyger, saying in part, “There is one overriding reason that I have not taken any administrative or employment action against Officer Amber Guyger.
 I don’t want to interfere with the on-going criminal investigation into her actions.”
 Also, in a town hall meeting last week, Hall again stood behind her choice to refuse to fire Guyger, claiming it would be against the law.
 “I can’t do that because there are both local, state and federal laws that prohibit me from taking action.
 There are civil service laws we have to adhere to,” said Hall.
 Apparently, it is no longer against the law.
 This news will likely be well received by the Jean family as well as the activists who have been calling for justice for Botham since the beginning.
 As TFTP previously reported, the idea of not firing Guyger seemed utterly preposterous as she admitted to doing something wrong.
 While controversy swarms the case of why she may have killed Jean, there is no doubt that she did kill him.
 This is a fact.
 This public servant walked into an innocent man’s home and shot him dead.
 Because of her actions, this man no longer lives.
 This alone should have been enough to fire her.
 Surprisingly enough, NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch responded to the firing of Guyger with one word, “Good,” showing her support for the move.
 For those who don’t recall, Loesch sparked controversy earlier this month by claiming that if Botham Jean were a gun owner, he may be alive today.
 Indeed, as TFTP reported over the weekend, a father in Prince George’s County opened fire on officers as they wrongly entered his apartment.
 He shot two officers.
 Not only was he not arrested, but the police chief praised him and apologized.
 In response to Guyger’s termination, the family’s attorney, Lee Merritt noted that the family expressed “satisfaction” with the move.
 “The Jean family expressed satisfaction in this explanation and in Guyger’s termination.
 We see it as an initial victory — well received on the day Botham Jean is laid to rest in his native country in St. Lucia,” Merritt’s office said in a statement, adding that they are committed to see a “proper murder indictment, conviction and appropriate sentencing.”

"Accused Woman Abuser Keith Ellison Asks House Ethics to Investigate
 
 Well, unlike Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN), who is running for attorney general in Minnesota without an active attorney's license, has not stood before a committee to deny or address accusations against him by several women who have accused him of verbal and physical abuse.
 At least one woman even filed a police report about his abuse.
 No, Ellison has called on the House of Representatives, not the FBI, as Senate Democrats have urged in the case of Judge Kavanaugh, to investigate the claims.
 ""I am taking this step now because I am innocent and eager to see this entire matter resolved,” Ellison said in a statement.
 “These allegations have lingered in the public sphere, and remain unsubstantiated,"" he added.
 ""I welcome an investigation by the House to allow us to move on.""

 Well, that's not entirely accurate.
 We do have a police report, unlike the accusations against Brett Kavanaugh.
 Of course, his supporters have hired an attorney to perform an investigation.
 The Star Tribune reports:
 The Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party has hired attorney Susan Ellingstad to conduct a separate investigation.
 Ellingstad is a partner at the firm where attorney Charles Nauen, who represents the DFL, works.
 DFL Chairman Ken Martin said on Tuesday that the investigation was finished or close to finished and would be released soon.
 Ellison is also deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee.
 After the domestic abuse allegation emerged in August, the DNC said it is looking into what happened.
 “All allegations of domestic abuse are disturbing and should be taken seriously.
 We are working with the Minnesota state party to review these allegations,” a DNC spokeswoman said in a statement Wednesday morning, declining to comment further.
 The Democratic Party’s choice of Ellingstad to conduct the investigation was met with derision from many who said she is not independent, including Donald Trump Jr., who mocked the investigation in a Tweet Wednesday.
 The firm Ellingstad works for, Lockridge Grindal Nauen, has a political committee that has donated to both Republican and Democratic candidates, including Ellison, according to Federal Election Commission filings.
 The contributions to Democrats outweigh the Republicans by a margin of about four to one.
 As we previously reported:
 Rep. Keith Ellison, who is currently running for attorney general of Minnesota, is being accused of domestic violence against his former partner Karen Monahan.
 Austin Monahan, Karen Monahan’s son, aired the allegations in a Facebook post Saturday night.
 According to Austin Monahan, Ellison put his mother through “pure hell.” In the Facebook post, he claims to have seen a video of Ellison dragging Karen Monahan off the bed by her feet while screaming expletives at her.
 The alleged incident is just one of several, Austin Monahan warned.
 State Rep. Debra Hilstrom (D-Brooklyn Center) was quick to voice her concern over the accusations, calling on Ellison to “answer these allegations.” DFL-endorsed candidate for attorney general of Minnesota Matt Pelikan also reacted to the story, calling the allegations “extremely troubling.” Karen Monahan has also hinted at the alleged abuse on Twitter, telling Ellison that her “kids, job, health, finances, humanity was deeply impacted by the abuse you are well aware of.” Karen Monahan claims she has videos, recordings, and messages to prove her story.
 Ellison has admitted the relationship, but is denying the abuse.
 And the relationship was clearly real.
 Karen Monahan, an organizer with the Sierra Club, was in a relationship with Ellison for years.
 The two are seen together in many of her social media posts, including hiking in together national parks and posing with the Obamas at the White House.
 Records show she lived in his Minneapolis home before their relationship ended.
 Ellison, who was previously married to a different woman, is divorced.
 It's hard to know what really happened in a relationship.
 And the media has kept it quiet.
 ""Keith Ellison flatly denies allegation that he abused an ex girlfriend.
 The story had been circulating in MN, and not held up under media scrutiny, so no stories ran.
 It blew up last night after the ex’s son posted the allegation on Facebook.""
 Dave Weigel.
 It's not quite the first time for Keith X.
 This is not the first time Ellison has faced misconduct allegations.
 In 2006, a woman named Amy Alexandar claimed that Ellison ostracized her and smeared her name after having an extramarital affair with her in the 1990s and then again in the 2000s.
 Ellison in 2005 filed a restraining order against her after what he described as phone and email harassment.
 She subsequently tried to get a restraining order against him, which a judge denied, ordering her to stop repeating allegations of an affair or intimidation.
 Ellison subsequently agreed to dismiss his restraining order against her if she no longer contacted him.
 I'm not sure that this is nothing more than damage control just before the elections.
 Ellison won the primary days after the allegations were made public.
 Of course, accusations does not make one guilty for Ellison anymore than they do for Judge Kavanaugh.
 However, at least in the case of Ellison, at least one of the women were not scared about their reputation and had any political motive to call the police and file a report.
 When it comes to Ellison though, we know he is an effeminate pansy who simply does not want to answer to the American people and even seeks security to hide from a female report with a mic and a camera.
 Judge Kavanaugh has faced it all and fought back against it.

"Star Tribune Sues To Unseal Accused Serial Woman Abuser Keith Ellison's Divorce Records
 
 Flashback in 2004, when up until then, Barack Obama couldn’t win an election.
 But during his 2004 campaign for the Senate, Obama and his corrupt party in Chicago somehow managed to unseal the divorce records of his opponent Jack Ryan, who was leading by a large margin.
 The Ryan divorce records were sealed at their mutual request of both Mr. and Mrs. Ryan.
 But the Democrat machine got them unsealed anyway.
 Barack Obama’s backers emailed reporters about the divorce controversy.
 The divorce records were not pretty.
 Ryan resigned.
 Obama took the field.
 Different rules for the lawless party.
 STAR TRIBUNE SUES TO UNSEAL U.S. REP. KEITH ELLISON’S DIVORCE RECORDS

 The Star Tribune has joined a legal effort to unseal the divorce records of U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison, the Democratic candidate for attorney general.
 Ellison and his ex-wife, Kim Ellison, divorced in 2012.
 The related records have been sealed, so the public cannot access the information.
 The Star Tribune’s motion to intervene and unseal the records follows a similar action by Alpha News, a right-leaning online news and opinion site.
 The efforts follow allegations by Ellison’s ex-girlfriend, Karen Monahan, that Ellison domestically abused her in 2016.
 He has denied the allegation repeatedly, and Monahan has continued to press her case in frequent tweets about Ellison.
 On Sunday, Monahan tweeted to Ellison: “This is not going away and you are making it worse for you, your family and district by lying, smearing, getting others to do your dirty work, victim shaming, etc.” She referred again to a video she says she has of Ellison dragging her off a bed, which he has said did not happen.
 She has declined to show the video, saying it is traumatizing.
 She also told CNN she misplaced it.
 Monahan also recently released a medical record that shows she told a doctor in 2017 that she had been in an abusive relationship with Ellison.
 Ken Martin, the chairman of the Minnesota DFL, said Tuesday that the party’s investigation of the allegations against Ellison will be finished soon, then released to the public.
 An external investigator was hired to conduct the inquiry.
 The Star Tribune argued that, given the public interest around that situation and Kim Ellison’s public support of her ex-husband, the divorce records are a matter of concern to voters.
 Divorce records are typically public, but judges will often agree to seal them if both parties to the case agree and no one else objects.
 The Ellison campaign released a statement from Kim Ellison on behalf of both her and Keith Ellison.
 “Our divorce simply isn’t the public’s business, and therefore, when we separated, we jointly asked the court to seal the file.
 Now, one month before a closely contested election for Minnesota Attorney General, a conservative group wants to probe our divorce file in search of something to use against Keith in this race.
 I am disappointed that the Star Tribune would choose to file this motion.”

"Why the Coordinated Alternative Media Purge Should TERRIFY Everyone: Soon Those Who Hate Freedom Will Have Unquestioned Access to the Minds of 2 Billion People
 
 Yesterday, the alternative media purge was boldly advanced in a coordinated effort to silence people who dissent from establishment views.
 It’s just one more step toward a monopoly on information by those who hate freedom.
 At this rate, they’ll soon have unquestioned access to the minds of more than 2 billion people.
 And this should terrify everyone who wants to be free to question the status quo and to seek a wide range of information.
 Hundreds of alternative media site administrators logged onto Facebook to discover that their accounts had been removed.
 Soon after, many of these sites and their writers found that their Twitter accounts had also been suspended.
 Popular pages like The AntiMedia (2.1 million fans), The Free Thought Project (3.1 million fans), Press for Truth (350K fans), Police the Police (1.9 million fans), Cop Block (1.7 million fans), and Punk Rock Libertarians (125K fans) are just a few of the ones which were unpublished.
 Why were these alternative media accounts removed?

 The reason given doesn’t really add up.
 Facebook told the LA Times that these pages had violated the company’s spam policies.
 “Today, we’re removing 559 Pages and 251 accounts that have consistently broken our rules against spam and coordinated inauthentic behavior,” the company said in a blog post.
 “People will only share on Facebook if they feel safe and trust the connections they make here.” (source)
 But this isn’t actually what their spam policy says.
 Here’s the policy.
 We work hard to limit the spread of commercial spam to prevent false advertising, fraud, and security breaches, all of which detract from people’s ability to share and connect.
 We do not allow people to use misleading or inaccurate information to collect likes, followers, or shares.
 Do Not: Artificially increase distribution for financial gain
 Create or use fake accounts or compromise other people’s accounts to
 Impersonate or pretend to be a business, organization, public figure, or private individual
 Attempt to create connections, create content, or message people
 Restrict access to content by requiring people to like, share, or recommend before viewing
 Encourage likes, shares, or clicks under false pretenses
 Maliciously use login credentials or personally identifiable information by:
 Attempting to gather or share login credentials or personally identifiable information
 Using another person’s login credentials or personally identifiable information
 Promise non-existent Facebook features (source)
 The Washington Post originally said that these pages were purged for “pushing political messages for profit” as you can see by their URL:
 https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/10/11/facebook-purged-over-accounts-pages-pushing-political-messages-profit/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.fa1a364488b3
 But of course, since they too push political messages for profit (waaah, Trump!)
 as do all the other corporate media outlets out there, they changed their headline to “Facebook purged over 800 U.S. accounts and pages for pushing political spam.”
 The fact that many of these accounts were also suspended by Twitter shortly thereafter should tell you that this is a coordinated effort to silence large swaths of the population.
 Of course, the best coverage of this is from…Russia.
 Sputnik News contacted many of the alternative journalists who were purged to get their take on what happened.
 You may recall that basically every blogger outside the establishment media was accused of being secretly Russian during the 2016 election by the Washington Post, so perhaps actual Russians have a vested interest in the truth coming out on this topic.
 My friend John Vibes is an amazing person who contributes to The Free Thought Project.
 He said:
 This signifies a re-consolidation of the media.
 Cable news media controlled the narrative for most of modern history, but the internet has lowered that barrier to entry and allowed the average person to become the media themselves.
 This obviously took market share and influence away from the traditional media, and it has allowed for a more diverse public conversation.
 Now it seems the platforms that have monopolized the industry are favoring mainstream sources and silencing alternative voices.
 So now, instead of allowing more people to have a voice, these platforms are creating an atmosphere where only powerful media organizations are welcome, just as we had on cable news.
 People think that we are just providing an activist spin on the news, but they don’t see the families struggling to have their voice heard.
 For example, when someone is shot by police, mainstream media sources often just republish the press release from the police department, without presenting the victim’s side of the story.
 We give the victims and their families a voice, which is essential to keep power in check.
 This also goes for bigger issues like foreign policy as well; multiple full-scale invasions of Syria have been prevented because of information that the alternative media made viral.
 (source)
 Nicholas Bernabe of The AntiMedia is another alternative journalist I consider a friend and support wholeheartedly.
 He’s worked tirelessly to be a voice of truth in a world of lies.
 He told Sputnik:
 Our approach generally is to cover stories and angles that corporate media underreport or misreport and to amplify activist and anti-war voices and stories.
 All of our content is professionally fact-checked and edited.
 I got into this line of work because I felt there was a need for media that challenged mainstream assumptions and biases in politics.
 I wanted to shed light on corruption and wrongdoing against oppressed peoples and cover the harsh truth about American foreign policy.
 Over the last 28 days, we reached 7,088,000 people on Facebook.
 The timing of this purge is rather dubious in my view, coming shortly before the midterm elections.
 This could be an attempt by Facebook itself to affect the outcome of the coming elections.
 The Twitter suspension caught me by surprise.
 I can only speculate that these suspensions were a coordinated effort to stifle our message ahead of the coming elections.
 (source)
 Remember, this is coordinated, across multiple platforms.
 Remember when this happened to Alex Jones?
 Back in September, an assault was led by YouTube, Google, and Facebook against Alex Jones of Infowars fame.
 All of his accounts were shut down in quick succession, followed by his credit card processing companies and his newsletter service providers.
 I wrote at the time, “Alex Jones is just the beginning of this purge.
 It’s going to get much worse.”
 Meanwhile, other dissenting voices were being silenced on social media with limited reach and “shadow banning.”
 Infowars is a massive profit machine.
 But what happens when similar attacks are launched on smaller alternative media outlets?
 It hits us right in the wallet.
 And if they’re hit hard enough, they’ll cease to be able to function.
 Jones has a lot of money so this may not be the end of him, but for most website owners, this would be the absolute end of our ability to do business.
 And to be able to bring the information we bring, we do have to run our websites as businesses.
 It’s far more expensive than most people realize to run a site.
 I know that my own operating costs every month are more than $2000.
 A site as big as Jones’s would be many times that amount.
 When all your avenues of monetization are cut off, it wouldn’t be hard for a site – and the dissent and information they share – to cease to exist.
 (source)
 This is not just about Facebook or Twitter.
 It’s about the ability to find dissenting information, period.
 Google is in on it too.
 A leaked document from Google supported the idea of censorship.
 Another Google document has found its way into the public domain, this time through Breitbart.
 The news publication reports that an 85-page briefing entitled “The Good Censor,” advises tech companies to “police tone instead of content” and to not “take sides” when censoring users… Google might continue to shift with the times – changing its stance on how much or how little it censors (due to public, governmental or commercial pressures).
 If it does, acknowledgment of what this shift in position means for users and for Google is essential.
 Shifting blindly or silently in one direction or another rightly incites users’ fury… The Google “internal research” even quotes outside experts like George Soros who express justification of censorship in non-U.S. markets, noting that Google should police “tone instead of content” and “censor everyone equally,” as Breitbart put it.
 (source)
 There are 2 trillion Google searches per day.
 PER.
 DAY.
 That should give you an idea of the power of something like Google.
 Combine it with billions of Facebook and Twitter users and you can easily see the influence wielded here.
 This is where free thought goes to die.
 Ron Paul reminds us that truth is treason.
 Ron Paul, former senator and the libertarian voice of reason, said when Jones was purged:
 “You get accused of treasonous activity and treasonous speech because in an empire of lies the truth is treason,” Paul told the Russia-based news outlet.
 “Challenging the status quo is what they can’t stand and it unnerves them, so they have to silence people.” “Some of us tell the truth about our government, they call us treasonous and say we’re speaking out of line and they’d like to punish us, and I think that’s part of what’s happening with social media,” Paul told RT, adding that he hopes anti-government or anti-war voices can eliminate their “dependency” on the current social media platforms.
 “I’m just hoping that technology can stay ahead of it all and that we can have real alternatives to the dependency on Twitter and other companies that have been working hand in glove with the government,” Paul added.
 (source)
 Here’s a video from last month with Dr. Paul’s thoughts about the social media purge.
 In it, he reminds us that Facebook is a private entity so they do have every right to remove the pages they wish.
 The danger – and the area in which this treads on the First Amendment – is their direct ties to the government.
 This affects everyone.
 If you’re reading this and you shrug because you, personally, don’t have a Twitter or Facebook account, you’re missing the bigger point.
 Consider the fact that the “population” of Facebook is bigger than the populations of the US, China, and Brazil combined.
 That’s how many people will now only receive one side of the story on things like war, politics, guns, and current events.
 People will believe what they’re told because there is no alternative information presented.
 There are no questions asked.
 It’s literally the textbook definition of brainwashing.
 Definition of brainwashing
 1: a forcible indoctrination to induce someone to give up basic political, social, or religious beliefs and attitudes and to accept contrasting regimented ideas 2: persuasion by propaganda or salesmanship (source)
 (Here’s an article from Psychology Today that discusses how Facebook is, in fact, brainwashing people for profit.)
 Social media is a massive source of information and influence today.
 If the information is rigged by entities that support socialism, gun control, and the end of privacy, we’re doomed.
 2.2 billion active users will be bombarded with these messages without any real option for the other side of the story.
 So regardless of whether you, personally, participate, this will color popular sentiment to a massive degree.
 It will grow the cognitive dissonance that assures people of things like “the government is your friend” and that “you don’t need to protect yourself, the police will take care of you.”
 People who hate freedom will get unfettered access to the minds of 2 billion people.
 That should scare the crap out of you.
 What can you do about the alternative media purge?
 It’s possible but unlikely that social pressure on Facebook and Twitter will push the outlets into restoring the accounts of these alternative media networks.
 But even if they are restored, I suspect their reach will dwindle even further.
 Here are a few things you can do:
 Subscribe to the newsletters of websites you enjoy.
 Don’t count on seeing their work on social media.
 (You can subscribe to my newsletter here, incidentally.)
 Support them financially if you can.
 Many sites have Patreon accounts or donate buttons
 Bookmark them and visit regularly – if they have ads, your visits help them to make the money they need to stay afloat.
 Share their articles on your own social media accounts.
 If they can’t get their work out there, we can help.
 Join alternative social media outlets like Gab and MeWe.
 The truth is getting harder and harder to find.
 You’re going to have to dig for it.
 We’re watching the biggest campaign against freedom of speech and thought that has ever occurred in our part of the world.
 The alternative media purge is just the beginning.
 And we should all be very concerned.

 October 11, 2018, will be remembered in history as the day the tech giants attempted to wipe out independent, liberty-minded, antiwar media from the airwaves.
 On Thursday, in a coordinated effort, hundreds of pages devoted to peace and liberty were memory-holed by social media giants.
 As part of its purge, Facebook has removed the pages of several police accountability/watchdog/critic groups, including Cop Block, the Free Thought Project, and Police the Police.
 They've also apparently severely restricted activity for the Photography Is Not a Crime page.

 What makes this recent purge from Facebook and Twitter so egregious is that the pages like the Free Thought Project, the Anti-Media, Press for Truth, and dozens of others, did not fit the hate speech narrative these same companies used to wipe out Alex Jones.
 Instead, these pages were dedicated to spreading peace, bridging the divide, bringing humanity together and holding government accountable.
 And how does this poem end, again?
 https://t.co/nUZ82x9JFt — Anya Parampil (@anyaparampil) August 6, 2018
 The purge happened around 12:30 p.m. CST with mainstream news reports launching at the same time — implying that they were given the heads up about the move.
 In a statement co-authored by Facebook Head of Cybersecurity Nathaniel Gleicher — who Caitlin Johnstone aptly points out, also happens to be the former White House National Security Council Director of Cybersecurity Policy — the massive social media platform explained that it has removed “559 Pages and 251 accounts that have consistently broken our rules against spam and coordinated inauthentic behavior.”
 Facebook said the pages were “working to mislead others about who they are, and what they are doing.” However, this couldn’t be further from the truth.
 Our names, addresses, and phone numbers were on all of our pages and our profiles.
 “We were verified by Facebook with a little check mark next to our name, so they know we are a legitimate organization/outlet.
 They have seen our “Articles of Organization” which was issued by the state of Louisiana, which is where my partner and The Free Thought Project co-founder lives,” Jason Bassler, co-founder of the Free Thought Project explained.
 However, in their statement, Facebook then suggested the real reason behind the purge — elections are coming — and pesky folks like the independent media have a way of reporting information on candidates that the mainstream tends to ignore — like war, corruption, and most recently, Brett Kavanaugh’s disdain for the Constitution.
 “Given the activity we’ve seen — and its timing ahead of the US midterm elections — we wanted to give some details about the types of behavior that led to this action,” Facebook said, before accusing us of hawking fake products or functioning as ad farms that tricked “people into thinking that they were forums for legitimate political debate.”
 It should be stated that TFTP never hid the fact that we worked with other independent media groups to share our information around the web — this is the very definition of grassroots.
 But all of us together certainly posed a threat to the mainstream so this nonsense about tricking people was brought into play.
 Within all of our pages under the Free Thought umbrella, we had close to 6 million followers.
 Does Facebook think it knows better than the 6 million people who clicked like on our page?
 We also had close to 16,000 reviews on our page with an average 4.1 star rating, directly showing that people desired to see what we were putting out.
 The only ones manipulating people here are the tech giants themselves.
 All but proving the case that this was a coordinated attack by the tech giant community, shortly after the purge on Facebook, Twitter followed suit, wiping out our profiles on there as well.
 They gave absolutely no reason for the suspension.
 “This signifies a re-consolidation of the media.
 Cable news media controlled the narrative for most of modern history, but the internet has lowered that barrier to entry and allowed the average person to become the media themselves.
 This obviously took market share and influence away from the traditional media, and it has allowed for a more diverse public conversation.
 Now it seems the platforms that have monopolized the industry are favoring mainstream sources and silencing alternative voices.
 So now, instead of allowing more people to have a voice, these platforms are creating an atmosphere where only powerful media organizations are welcome, just as we had on cable news,” John Vibes poignantly noted.
 The bottom line is that sites like ours and the others who were wiped from the internet yesterday represent a voice against the plutocratic information-controlling establishment.
 We challenge their paradigm of control and this is a thorn in their side.
 There are no longer distinct lines between social media giants and government either which renders the “they are private, they can do what they wish” argument moot.
 Facebook has been partnering with the Digital Forensics Lab, an arm of the Atlantic Council think tank — a neoconservative group funded by Gulf monarchies, defense giants like Raytheon, megabanks like HSBC, foreign state actors, and the US government — to weed out people like us who challenge the status quo.
 The entity that is making censorship decisions for Facebook, as publicly announced, is the Atlantic Council, a partly US government-funded entity.
 At what point will the extremely tight ties between these companies and the US government end the ""they are private"" argument?
 — Daniel McAdams (@DanielLMcAdams) October 12, 2018
 Serving as a kick in the teeth to the thousands of people who lost their livelihoods yesterday because of this purge is the fact that pages who do set out to deliberately deceive people, put out actual fake news, and slander others — like the infamous Your News Wire — remain intact and able to post.
 No, we are not calling for these fake pages to be removed, but instead using it as a point of reference as to why they targeted us when pages like YNW have become famous for spreading lies and deceiving people.
 Those who demanded Facebook & other Silicon Valley giants censor political content - something they didn't actually want to do - are finding that content that they themselves support & like end up being repressed.
 That's what has happened to every censorship advocate in history: https://t.co/IZHF8GVkgC — Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) October 12, 2018
 Indeed, we have reached the precipice of corporate-state censorship.
 Those who have constantly demanded that tech giants silence their critics and information that ‘offends’ them are finally seeing the inevitable results of such irresponsible acts.
 As we have been pointing out for the last two years, tech monopolies large enough to silence those with whom you disagree, are large enough to one day silence you.
 The silver lining to this massive purge of independent media is that it signals the beginning of the end of censored media.
 TFTP has been planning for this day and we have been growing our email list and our subscriber base.
 We will not be silenced.
 While it may seem bleak for now, we will rise from the ashes of the social media dinosaurs to help build and create new platforms that are out of their control where ideas of peace and freedom can be discussed openly without fear of devoting years to a platform that can disappear you in the blink of an eye.

"More Independent Media To Be Shut Down
 
 The very word “secrecy” is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings.
 We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it.
 Even today, there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions.
 Even today, there is little value in insuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it.
 And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment.
 – JFK
 If you haven’t already heard, Facebook has completely shut down hundreds, if not thousands of Independent media pages over the last year.
 Some of the biggest pages include The Free Thought Project and The Anti-media, with millions of followers each, and years of sourced journalism.
 These pages, among others, became targets a long time ago.
 Working directly in the field and behind the scenes, I can tell you that all of us have been aware of the censorship initiative for a long time because it started approximately three years ago now.
 The complete deletion of multiple pages kicked off by popular media figure Alex Jones, was followed by a massive campaign of “fake news” awareness.
 One thing we need to remember here is, this isn’t about democrats vs republicans, it’s about the elite preserving their control, and at the moment, they are using the DNC as the mouthpiece for that.
 Thus, anything that slandered Hillary Clinton during the presidential campaign, for example, was labelled as fake news, even if evidence and credible sources were used.
 This is because she is part of that elite.
 This is cyber false flagging at its finest, where authority figures at Facebook and within government agencies decide for the people what is real, and what is not, These tactics are complemented by a large mainstream media campaign that created awareness about fake news.
 Monkey see, monkey do.

 Many believed what media and social media did during that election, and still now, and take on the opinion that people cannot just say what they want on the internet.
 This has some validity, but ultimately, the fact that Facebook pages with credibility were deleted makes it quite clear what’s going on here.
 These pages presented declassified documents, information about corporations and mainstream media, real whistleblower testimony and more.
 Yet still, they were deleted.
 The population should be able to examine a source of information and determine for themselves if it’s credible, not have an authority figure do it for them.
 We don’t need fact checkers, we ourselves should be those fact checkers!
 We have a responsibility to our planet to be those fact checkers, and not let authority figures with a tremendous amount of power, wealth, and conflicts of interests do it for us.
 “The problem of fake news isn’t solved by hoping for a referee, but rather because we as citizens, we as users of these services, help each other.
 We talk and we share and we point out what is fake.
 We point out what is true.
 The answer to bad speech is not censorship, the answer to bad speech is more speech.
 We have to exercise and spread the idea that critical thinking matters, now more than ever, given the fact that lies seem to be getting more popular.” –Edward Snowden (source)
 Facebook A Revolving Door
 Facebook has become a revolving door like Monsanto, with high-ranking DARPA employees, like Regina Duggan, who has since left Facebook, and people from similar backgrounds now spearheading their mission.
 What is Facebook’s mission?
 Well at the moment it seems to be censoring of information.
 Their key strategy is to label everything as fake news to build an excuse to delete Facebook pages that are dissenting voices.
 You see, independent media, like CE, became extremely popular, receiving many millions in website every single month, that traffic came from Facebook.
 Independent media outlets were greatly surpassing mainstream media in their power and voice.
 This is something people on the outside can’t really see as all of this happens, but I am on the inside, so I see exactly what’s taking place.
 Eyes were shifting away from the small group of people who have controlled media since media’s inception.
 Independent media brought to light a number of facts that threaten the agenda of the global elite, like intelligence agency/government connections to mainstream media for example, and their plans in the middle east to basically invade, take-over, and establish a government that suits the Deep State’s best interests.
 There are several examples from all fields that surround human life, from healthcare to politics, and it all seems to be controlled by one massive conglomerate at the top.
 We’ve been writing about this for nearly a decade now.
 The Deep State Has Power Due To Our Unconsciousness
 They (global elite) continue to do what they are able to do because of human consciousness.
 The more people who consider this a “conspiracy theory” and turn their heads away, the easier it is for them to continue and have power.
 I don’t understand how so much information can come to light, yet when it’s deemed a “conspiracy” theory” within mainstream media, everybody simply follows the rhetoric, without doing any investigation or research for themselves.
 If you don’t look into it, don’t share an opinion on it.
 “Condemnation without investigation is the height of ignorance.” – Einstein.
 All of these media sources were operating normally until Donald Trump became president, and until Hillary Clinton, Obama, Bush, etc were outed as global elite puppets.
 Heck, the Clinton’s and John Podesta have even referenced Wikileaks before that became ‘fake.’ Despite operating with credibility for more than a decade before the accusations.
 What does the media operating normally mean?
 Still manipulating the public, but at least they were reporting on both sides as a whole.
 Now, it’s quite different.
 Donald Trump is extremely vilified not because he allegedly is/was racist/sexist, but because he threatens neoliberalism and neoconservatism, the American empire, one that continues to try and push an Orwellian state type of existence, which seems to be ramping up every single year.
 Trump was not supposed to win, and no this isn’t about democrats vs republicans or that Trump is a saviour.
 The Deep State responded like they always do every time something ‘goes wrong,’ they blamed Russia, as well as media outlets like Collective Evolution and others.
 Some of which have now been deleted as mentioned above.
 Trump is Not The Solution, We Are
 Things are getting pretty ridiculous, but they’re too late.
 Even if they do succeed in deleting more independent media sites from social media, they cannot erase them from the internet.
 Yes, social media platforms were great for spreading information across the internet and for having more people become aware of it.
 It really showed what people were interested in, and what people wanted to see, but clearly, we do not live in a democracy and that doesn’t matter.
 Against the State: An ... Llewellyn H. Rockwell Jr. Best Price: $9.94 Buy New $9.95 (as of 01:45 EST - Details)
 People are still going to search for information, and alternative forms of information, given the fact that what they see coming from the mainstream is usually highly suspect and questionable.
 More and more people see it this way because our consciousness continues to shift.
 Social media platforms do not control the awakening but have been a great tool to grow it, but it’s something that cannot be stopped.
 The more we awaken and truly see past the political games, the more we pull power from the power grid that keeps all this in place.
 2020
 Now, all of this seems to be taking place with perfect timing before the 2020 election.
 No doubt that the Deep State will want to take back the presidency, but ultimately, we need to see the bigger picture here.
 We need to see what politics actually is, and the past few years alone have provided us with the opportunity to see.
 It’s nothing but elite people, corporations and the financial elite that have become drenched with so much power that they have been able to direct human will and use it for their own selfish purposes.
 With powerful revelations that have come to light, like elite pedophilia and ritual abuse, and extreme corruption, why do we still participate?
 Why do we choose to elect these people?
 Why do we believe we live in a democracy when what people want to look at, and what the majority of people want to have done (like GMO-labelling), is completely censored?
 Why are harmful ‘things’ surrounding us constantly when we have science showing it’s not safe, like cell phone towers etc.
 It’s simply because power lies within the corporatocracy.
 Decisions aren’t being made with the best interest of humanity at heart, and this is why the system is failing because it’s not actually for the people.
 Today the path to total dictatorship in the U.S. can be laid by strictly legal means … We have a well-organized political-action group in this country, determined to destroy our Constitution and establish a one-party state … It operates secretly, silently, continuously to transform our Government … This ruthless power-seeking elite is a disease of our century… This group … is answerable neither to the President, the Congress, nor the courts.
 It is practically irremovable.
 – Senator William Jenner (source)
 Before 2020, they’re going to want to silence anything that creates awareness about the corruption, deceit and lies that have dominated the presidency and the entire military-industrial complex for years.
 The fact of the matter is:
 “The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society.
 Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country.
 We are governed, our minds are moulded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of.” – Edward Bernays (“the father of public relations”), Propaganda, 1928 (note that Bernays’ book, Propaganda, begins with the above quote).
 This is what’s unravelling, and the stronger the push the unravel it, the stronger the reaction and response from the deep state.
 The Takeaway
 Recognize what’s happening, the massive censorship of information, coupled with the ridicule or finger pointing, or even arrest of people who choose to voice an opinion in opposition to the rhetoric that’s constantly spewed by mainstream media, which in turn is usually believed by the masses.
 At the same time, independent media represents a shift in consciousness.
 A shift in our perceptions, thoughts, feelings and general self-awareness about our own planet is changing, and thus, change has been sprouted in multiple different areas, including political corruption and the stranglehold it has over our world.
 We are more aware, but there is still some ways to go…
 A good chunk of work has been done.
 A massive transformation of consciousness has taken place and it seems that a global mass is growing closer to a critical mass.
 The censorship of independent media is irrelevant in a sense, because the shift will continue to happen, change will continue to happen, and information that the deep state does not want the public to become aware of will keep making its way into transparency.
 Independent media will continue to have the opportunity to share information because of a lack of credible information and plain truth within the mainstream.
 People are hungry for it, and will seek it out themselves.

"White House Restores CNN Acosta’s Pass But Imposes Strict Conduct Rules
 
 Thanks to Jim Acosta, all White House correspondents have to adhere to the new rules.
 CNN’s White House correspondent Jim Acosta will get his “hard pass” restored, but thanks to his antics and confrontations with President Trump and White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, all journalists seeking access to the presidential press room will now have to abide by written rules of conduct due to his misbehavior.
 Sanders and deputy chief of staff for communications Bill Shine sent a letter to Acosta on Monday, notifying him that his hard pass was restored, but that it could be suspended or revoked again if he fails to abide by the new rules that apply to all White House correspondents going forward.
 Under the rules laid out in the letter, each journalist gets “a single question” before having to yield the floor, with follow-ups solely at the discretion of White House officials.
 Failure to obey the rules may result in suspension or revocation of the “hard pass,” the document allowing major networks regular access to the White House, RT reports.

 “Should you refuse to follow these rules in the future, we will take action in accordance with the rules,” wrote Sanders and Shine.
 Acosta’s pass was yanked following an incident at President Donald Trump’s November 7 press conference, where the CNN correspondent argued with Trump instead of asking questions (not for the first time) and physically prevented a White House intern from taking the microphone away from him.
 CNN responded by suing the White House, claiming that Acosta’s due process and free speech rights were being infringed.
 Last week, a federal judge ordered the pass temporarily restored on due process grounds.
 In response to the letter, CNN dropped the lawsuit.
 Mainstream media outlets that had joined CNN in suing Trump celebrated Monday’s letter, framing it as the White House “backing down” in face of the legal challenge while largely ignoring the implications of the new rules: that the media critical of Trump might have won a battle, but lost the war.
 White House backs down from legal fight, restores Jim Acosta's press passhttps://t.co/LQoIVgSnCv — AprilDRyan (@AprilDRyan) November 19, 2018
 “We have created these rules with a degree of regret,” Sanders and Shine wrote.
 “But, given the position taken by CNN, we now feel obligated to replace previously shared practices with explicit rules.”
 This means that Acosta, or any other reporter covering the White House, can get their pass suspended or revoked over specific conduct going forward, without having a leg to stand on in terms of due process.
 That leaves the First Amendment grounds, effectively arguing that access to the White House is a civil right under the US Constitution, for which there is no precedent under US law.

"Stacey Abrams to Sue Georgia Over ‘Gross Mismanagement’ of Elections
 
 Stacey Abrams quits race for governor of Georgia, accusing rival Republican Brian Kemp of voter suppression.
 1.2k SHARES Facebook Twitter
 Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams may have begrudgingly recognized her rival’s victory, but she is far from done fighting for what she believes was her due.
 With a team of three dozen lawyers, Abrams has announced she would file a federal suit against Georgia for “gross mismanagement” of the vote.
 Abrams and civil rights groups accused the winner, Republican Brian Kemp of purging thousands from voting rolls in that capacity.
 Abrams remained about 18,000 votes short of a result that would have required a runoff between her and Kamp in December.
 The Associated Press (AP) reported her team amassed nearly three-dozen lawyers who will draft a petition, along with affidavits from voters and would-be voters who argue that they were allegedly disenfranchised during the election.

 In a speech on Nov. 19 right at the cutoff for Georgia counties to certify election results, Abrams delivered a speech in which she said, “I acknowledge that former Secretary of State Brian Kemp will be certified as the victor in the 2018 gubernatorial election.” However, Abrams said Kemp had relied on “suppression of the people’s democratic right to vote” that was “deliberate and intentional.”
 Kemp tried to move past the contentious campaign even if his opponent wasn’t willing.
 “The election is over and hardworking Georgians are ready to move forward,” he said.
 “We can no longer dwell on the divisive politics of the past but must focus on Georgia’s bright and promising future.”

 #gapol (1 of 3) — Brian Kemp (@BrianKempGA) November 16, 2018
 Breitbart reports:
 Abrams could decide as early as Friday whether to go to court.
 Under Georgia election law, a losing candidate can challenge the result of an election based on “misconduct, fraud or irregularities … sufficient to change or place in doubt the results.”
 Allegra Lawrence-Hardy, Abrams’ campaign chair, said that her legal team is “considering all options,” which also includes federal court remedies.
 Some Democratic legal observers note Abrams would be dependent on statues that set a high bar for the court to intervene.
 Abrams Republican challenger, Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, has held the lead and is expected to be declared the winner on Friday, charged that Abrams has led a “publicity stunt” and her refusal to concede the election serves as a “ridiculous temper tantrum.”
 Abrams faces a narrow path to winning the Georgia gubernatorial election.
 Preliminary election results show Kemp winning with about 50.2 percent of the vote, which puts him with over 18,000 voters over the threshold required to win by a majority and avoid a December 4 election runoff.
 Lawrence-Hardy told the AP that Abrams believes that many of her supporters, many of them minority and low-income voters who do not regularly vote, went to the polls and ran into electoral barriers, although she did not say what barriers they were.
 “These stories to me are such that they have to be addressed,” said Lawrence-Hardy.
 “It’s just a much bigger responsibility.
 I feel like our mandate has blossomed.
 … Maybe this is our moment.”

 CNN sues President Trump and top White House aides for barring Jim Acosta.
 557 SHARES Facebook Twitter
 CNN has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over the revocation of press credentials from its reporter Jim Acosta demanding they be restored.
 The suit alleges the ban violated both First and Fifth Amendment rights of the network and reporter.
 Last Wednesday White House press secretary Sarah Sanders made the announcement that Acosta’s press pass had been suspended as a result of an altercation during a press conference when Acosta refused to give up the microphone after several requests by President Trump to hand it over.
 Not only did Acosta refuse to hand over the microphone, but he pushed the female interns hand away when she tried to follow the presidents request to take the microphone away from Acosta, who has disputed the accusation claiming he never put his hands on the young woman.

 Watching the full exchange it is obvious that Trump was making a sincere effort to answer Acosta’s questions, the president actually took the time to answer three of his questions before losing his patients with an argumentative Acosta who refused to hand the mic over to the female intern forcefully pushing her arm away.
 Acosta can deny how the altercation took place, but the video shows the facts, which are that Acosta was out of line.
 The lawsuit was announced by CNN on Tuesday.
 The network is also asking the court for an “immediate restraining order requiring the pass be returned to Jim.”
 Both CNN and Acosta are plaintiffs in the lawsuit, and there are six defendants: Donald Trump himself, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, Chief of Staff John Kelly, his aide for communication Bill Shine, Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy, and the unidentified Secret Service officer who took the pass from Acosta.
 Fox News reports:
 “The wrongful revocation of these credentials violates CNN and Acosta’s First Amendment rights of freedom of the press, and their Fifth Amendment rights to due process,” CNN said in a statement.
 “We have asked the court for an immediate restraining order requiring the pass to be returned to Jim, and will seek permanent relief as part of this process.”
 CNN added that “the suit is specific to CNN and Acosta,” but said it could happen to anyone.
 “If left unchallenged, the actions of the White house would create a dangerous chilling effect for any journalist who covers our elected officials,” CNN said.
 This morning, CNN filed a lawsuit against @realDonaldTrump and top aides.
 The White House has violated CNN and @Acosta's First Amendment rights of freedom of the press and Fifth Amendment rights to due process.

 The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
 Last week, Acosta’s press pass to access the White House was suspended “until further notice” after he engaged in the contentious back-and-forth over the migrant caravan working its way up through Mexico.
 Trump characterizes the caravan as “an invasion,” a term to which Acosta objected.
 “Honestly, I think you should let me run the country and you run CNN,” the president said.
 The reporter tried to ask him another question before a female White House aide walked over to him.
 Trump then told him, “That’s enough!”
 Acosta continued to try to talk as the intern was seen trying to take the microphone from his hand.
 She grabbed the microphone but Acosta wouldn’t give it up and there was brief contact between the two.
 White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said the suspension of his press credentials stemmed from his “placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern.” She called the behavior “absolutely unacceptable.”
 Several news outlets accused Sanders of using a “doctored” video as evidence, but the press secretary didn’t back down from her decision.
 “We stand by our decision to revoke this individual’s hard pass.
 We will not tolerate the inappropriate behavior clearly documented in this video,” Sanders tweeted to accompany the allegedly doctored video.
 White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway has since said the video was simply “sped up.”
 An attorney for CNN and Acosta followed up with a separate statement, saying the law is “clear” that the Trump administration violated the First Amendment and Due process Clause.

"Report: Jim Acosta and CNN File Lawsuit Against Trump Administration
 
 CNN is taking the ongoing feud between President Trump and Jim Acosta to court.
 Appearing on CNN’s “Reliable Sources” this Sunday, ABC’s former White House correspondent Sam Donaldson made the claim that Jim Acosta and CNN had already filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over the White House’s decision to revoke the reporter’s press pass.
 It appears that CNN is setting the wheels in motion for a lawsuit against the White House for removing the press credentials of Jim Acosta following a tense incident Wednesday during a news conference at the White House.
 “I hope I’m not mistaken, but it’s my understanding that CNN and Acosta have sued, that there will be a court hearing on Tuesday on this very matter that we’ve been discussing,” Donaldson said.

 Donaldson claims that he has already been asked to prepare an affidavit to be submitted to court, likely due to Donaldson’s own reputation for confrontation with the White House, including trading personal insults with President George Bush in 2006, RT reports.
 Donaldson also said that he had sent Acosta an email which encouraged him to ‘Keep it up”, and not to worry about the “vicious attacks” and “threats”.
 CNN released a statement saying no decision has been made as of yet on the lawsuit.
 The network has reached out to the White House on the issue but has “gotten no response”.
 Sunday’s “Reliable Sources” also featured constitutional lawyer Floyd Mayweather who emphasized that CNN would have a “really strong lawsuit” if they chose to proceed.
 Last Wednesday White House press secretary Sarah Sanders made the announcement that Acosta’s press pass had been suspended as a result of a tussle with a White House intern over a microphone following his sharp back-and-forth with Trump during the President’s post-midterm Q&A.
 Acosta has disputed the accusation claiming he never put his hands on the young woman.
 Watching the full exchange it is obvious that President Trump was making a sincere effort to answer Acosta’s questions, the president actually took the time to answer three of his questions before rightfully losing his patients when Acosta refused to hand the mic over.
 Not only that, he used his hand to forcefully push the female interns arm away from the mic.
 Acosta should have been escorted from the room.
 He deserved to have his credentials revoked.

"White House Outlines Code Of Conduct For White House Press - If Those Don't Work, They'll Be Forced To Write More
 
 For any constitutionalist, the ruling by Trump-appointed Judge Timothy J. Kelly was nothing but surreal, and honestly, he should be impeached over his frivolous ruling that demanded the White House reinstate CNN reporter Jim Acosta's press pass.
 However, the White House has decided to comply, which I wonder just how dangerous a precedent this sets, and as a result, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders has issued a code of conduct for the White House press.
 We have created these rules with a degree of regret,” Sanders said in a statement.
 The fact that the White House submitted to such a ridiculous demand when it is simple human decency to conduct one's self in a proper manner, unlike how Jim Acosta treated both Sarah Sanders, President Donald Trump and a White House aide, is a testimony to how little those who represent us know of our Constitution.

 “We would have greatly preferred to continue hosting White House press conferences in reliance on a set of understood professional norms, and we believe the overwhelming majority of journalists covering the White House share that preference,” Sanders said.
 “But, given the position taken by CNN, we now feel obligated to replace previously shared practices with explicit rules.”
 Oh, but there's more.
 If journalists can't conduct themselves according to these rules, then there is no other option but to.... write more explicit rules!
 Seriously!
 “At this time, however, we have decided not to frame such rules in the hope that professional journalistic norms will suffice to regulate conduct in those places,” Sanders said.
 “If unprofessional behavior occurs in those settings, or if a court should decide that explicit rules are required to regulate conduct there, we will be forced to reconsider this decision.”
 The White House should be telling Judge Kelly where he can take his ruling, but they are trying to look like they are on the high ground while submitting to unconstitutional rulings from a federal judge who should know better.
 However, here are the new rules released by the White House Press Office.
 (1) A journalist called upon to ask a question will ask a single question and then will yield the floor to other journalists; (2) At the discretion of the President or other White House official taking questions, a follow-up question or questions may be permitted; and where a follow up has been allowed and asked, the questioner will then yield the floor; (3) “Yielding the floor” includes, when applicable, physically surrendering the microphone to White House staff for use by the next questioner; (4) Failure to abide by any of rules (1)-(3) may result in suspension or revocation of the journalist’s hard pass.
 I can see this going way downhill.
 If you want to deal with people like Acosta, at the moment they begin to show who and what they really are, stop calling on them for questions.
 This is my advice to the White House.
 Don't call on Jim Acosta another time for as long as he remains in the White House Press.
 Make him regret it the entire time he is there.

"Sore Loser: Stacey Abrams Ends Challenges In Georgia Gubernatorial Race - Won't Concede - Set To File Lawsuit
 
 Defeated Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams finally ended her challenges on Friday and ended her challenges against Republican opponent Brian Kemp.
 However, in the same breath that she ended the challenges, she also declared she would be filing a federal lawsuit over what she called ""gross mismanagement"" of elections.
 If you ask me, all she's looking for here will only hurt herself and her own party.
 This woman wouldn't even concede!
 Talk about a poor sport, but Democrats are often like that in these races.
 The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported:

 Stacey Abrams ended her run for Georgia governor on Friday, but the Democrat said she would not concede the contest to Republican Brian Kemp and planned to launch a voting rights group to file “major” litigation challenging election policies.
 As state officials prepare to certify the vote, Abrams acknowledged the law “allows no further viable remedy” to extend her quest to be the nation’s first black female governor.
 But she laced her speech with biting criticism of Kemp, who she accused of leveraging his role as the state’s top elections official to suppress voters.
 “I will not concede,” she added, “because the erosion of our democracy is not right.”
 You mean like having a sister waiting in the wings of any campaign lawsuits, Ms. Abrams?
 What about invalid provisional ballots getting mixed in with valid ones?
 Maybe a little electronic voter manipulation, Ms. Abrams?
 How about non-citizens and illegal aliens voting, Ms. Abrams?
 Are these evidence of the erosion of the democratic process?
 Sure they are and they appear to all be coming from the party that Stacey Abrams represents, but she's not going to talk about that.
 But she wasn't going to concede.
 Nope, that arrogant wanna-be first female governor of Georgia simply would not bow out gracefully.
 “To watch an elected official who claims to represent the people in this state baldly pin his hopes for election on the suppression of the people’s democratic right to vote has been truly appalling,” Abrams said.
 “So, let’s be clear,"" she continued.
 ""This is not a speech of concession.
 Because concession means to acknowledge an action is right, true or proper.
 As a woman of conscience and faith, I cannot concede that.
 But my assessment is the law currently allows no further viable remedy.”
 No, concession means ""a thing that is granted, especially in response to demands; a thing conceded.""
 Abrams was easily defeated in terms of votes.
 She was the one trying to ""find"" and count votes remember?
 She is the one claiming there was cancellation of hundreds of thousands of voter registrations.
 Where is her evidence?
 She has none.
 Stacey Abrams is a sore loser just like Hillary Clinton and this little temper tantrum she put on display will probably sink any chances she may have had in the future to run again.
 Good!
 Thank God, Georgia didn't elect this peach.

"Obama Judge Rules To Upend Georgia Election
 
 Who didn’t see this coming?
 The fix is in.
 They stole Arizona.
 One down three to go.
 A federal judge on Monday ordered Georgia take steps to protect provisional ballots and to wait until Friday to certify the results of the midterm elections that include an unsettled race for governor.
 Lauren Groh-Wargo, Abrams campaign manager, announced Judge Amy Totenberg’s decision late Monday.
 WSBTV.com reported that the judge’s 56-page ruling could affect thousands of provisional ballots.
 Groh-Wargo called the ruling “good news.”

 Brian Kemp, her Republican challenger, issued a statement a day earlier calling for Abrams to concede.
 Kemp has declared victory and said it is “mathematically impossible” for her campaign to force a runoff.
 Abrams’ campaign did not immediately respond to a phone call from Fox News late Monday night.
 Abrams, 44, a Democrat, has maintained that she will not concede until every vote has been counted, and pointed to the 5,000 votes tallied over the weekend that favored her.
 Totenberg, who was appointed by President Obama, ruled in connection to Common Cause’s lawsuit filed on Nov. 5.
 Totenberg’s order doesn’t change the Tuesday deadline for counties to certify their results.
 Common Cause, a nonpartisan group, claimed in the suit that Kemp, while secretary of state, failed to maintain “the security of voter information despite known vulnerabilities” leading up to the midterm.
 The suit blasted the state’s “provisional ballot scheme,” that could disenfranchise a registered voter at the ballot box.
 The suit pointed out cases where voters were turned around after computer glitches and cases where voters were not offered provisional ballots.
 One man voted for decades and was “disturbed” to learn his registration history was erased.
 The court ruled that the secretary of state’s office must establish a hotline and publicize it on its website for voters to see if their provisional ballots were counted.
 Totenberg also ruled that Georgia must not certify the election results before Friday at 5 p.m., which falls before the Nov. 20 deadline set by state law.
 “I am fighting to make sure our democracy works for and represents everyone who has ever put their faith in it.
 I am fighting for every Georgian who cast a ballot with the promise that their vote would count,” Abrams said in a statement explaining her refusal to end her bid to become the first black woman elected governor in American history.
 A total of 21,190 provisional ballots were cast in the state during the midterm, 12,151 were cast in 2014.
 Four Democratic-leaning counties with the largest number of provisional ballots — Cobb, DeKalb, Fulton, and Gwinnett – “had not yet reported their numbers to the secretary as of November 11,” the suit said.
 The lawsuit also asked that provisional ballots cast by a voter registered in another county be counted as if the voter had shown up at the wrong precinct.
 The lawsuit says that of the 1,556 provisional ballots Fulton County reported having rejected by Nov. 9, nearly 1,000 were disqualified because they were cast by voters whose registration records showed them registered in another county.
 Edgardo Cortes, who currently works as an election security adviser at New York University, said these uncounted provisional ballots could sway the election and, despite Kemp’s claims, his unofficial vote total is so close to 50 percent, a runoff is possible.
 Kemp was up 50.2 percent to Abrams’ 48.7 percent early Tuesday.
 More than 3.9 million votes were cast in the election, and Abrams would need to acquire more than 20,000 additional votes to force a runoff.
 Abrams’ campaign filed a lawsuit Sunday asking a federal court to push the deadline for counties to certify their results to Wednesday, while also requiring that elections authorities count certain provisional and absentee ballots that have been or would be rejected for “arbitrary reasons.”
 “This ruling is a victory for the voters of Georgia because we are all stronger when every eligible voter is allowed to participate in our elections,” Sara Henderson, executive director for Common Cause Georgia, which filed the lawsuit, told AJC.com.

 Notice how quickly the drive-by media and self-proclaimed ""fact checkers"" gunned down the Trump administration and Infowars with their lying propaganda over the video that was enhanced, not doctored, to demonstrate that all of them and Jim Acosta are lying through their Communist teeth?
 Yep, I noticed too, and now they're trying to move on, but I'm gonna get in one last bit before we do.
 Of course, Infowars' Paul Joseph Watson simply enhanced the video from C-SPAN, which was a gif image (motion picture), in order to show the point of contact that the lying media and ""fact checkers"" said didn't occur.
 Watson then went on to be happy that President Trump backed him up on his comments about the video.
 Take a look, and as always, PJW is hilarious in his presentation.
 If they're prepared to lie this shamelessly, what else are they lying about?

 Jim Acosta, you're lying.
 New York Times, you're lying.
 Every media outlet from the Associated Press to NBC, you're lying when you say the video was doctored and that Acosta didn't touch the woman.
 At least C-SPAN is neutral in the matter and simply let the video reprove every single one of them.
 But it's more than that, self-proclaimed ""fact checkers"" like Snopes simply posted an Associated Press article, which clearly biased towards indicating the video was ""doctored"" by saying it was sped up, but that's not doctoring.
 Doctoring is when you manipulate the content to misconstrue the reality of what took place.
 If you want to see doctoring, go to 0:58 of the video above, and don't be drinking anything when you do because it's hilarious.
 But it isn't just Snopes or Politifact and outlets like that.
 Take, for instance, websites like MediaBiasFactCheck.com, whom I had to have my attorneys send a letter for their libel and they didn't just correct it, they removed it entirely because they knew I was two days away from filing a lawsuit against them.
 MBFC actually called CNN ""left biased,"" which is correct but followed up with:
 Overall, we rate CNN left biased based on story selection that often favors the left.
 We rate them Mixed for factual reporting due to misinformation and failed fact checks from guests and pundits.
 However, CNN’s straight news reporting would earn a High rating for factual reporting.
 (5/16/2016) Updated (D. Van Zandt 6/15/2018)
 Straight reporting?
 You must be kidding me?
 Did David Van Zandt not watch Jim Acosta lie to Anderson Cooper about this episode and Cooper just sat there and let him lie to the American people, editing the video to not even show the point of contact in question?
 Why yes, yes, he did!
 Not only that but it appears the MBFC doesn't know the documented history of CNN's complete fabrication of ""news,"" telling stories that never happened.
 MBFC isn't qualified to comment on the subject.
 It isn't just MBFC though.
 Newcomer NewsGuard also covers for CNN.
 This is supposed to be an outlet, at least what I was told in email and phone communication, that is simply to determine transparency of websites.
 Instead, they not only do that, but they go on to do far more than that.
 In rating CNN, NewsGuard posts this nonsense.
 I'm sure NewsGuard, Yemile Bucay, Anna-Sophie Harling and Amy Westfeldt need to update this in the light of the obvious lies and editing of the Acosta video and decades of documented, outright lies and propaganda by the Clown News Network, but you can't expect real transparency from an outlet like Newsguard whose writers aren't transparent about their own political bias, can you?
 Nope, you can't, and you can't expect it when some of those writers write for other publications that don't measure up to NewsGuard's standards either.
 The reason this little incident shouldn't be let go of so soon is that it is one of the clearest demonstrations of the media's bias, which we all have, lies and propaganda.
 It should be used over and over in article after article to remind people about the total dishonesty and complete disregard for reporting the facts by outlets such as CNN and to not blindly trust self-proclaimed fact-checkers who will not tell you the truth either.
 CNN has lost its mind to the point that they are suing over Acosta losing his press pass.
 He was their inside boy, after all.
 But the real irony here is that the media labeled Paul Joseph Watson and Infowars as ""conspiracy theorists"" and yet, PJW has exposed their blatant conspiracy to smear President Trump, Sarah Sanders and the White House aide.
 And Jim Acosta believes he and CNN deal with facts and Infowars doesn't.
 Yeah, right!
 I'm sorry Jim, I can't hear you over the booming voice of your hypocrisy!

"Judge Orders White House To Restore Jim Acosta' Press Pass - Trump Responds
 
 A Trump appointed federal judge has order the White House to restore CNN reporter Jim Acosta's press pass after the White House revoked it for his badgering of the White House press secretary, his handling of a White House aide and his continual questioning when he was allowed to ask a question and follow up.
 The ruling has no basis in the Constitution, mind you.
 USA Today reported on the ruling:
 WASHINGTON – A federal judge on Friday ordered the White House to restore CNN reporter Jim Acosta’s press badge, which had been revoked earlier this month after a contentious exchange at a news conference with President Donald Trump.
 U.S. District Court Judge Timothy Kelly, a Trump appointee, said the White House had violated Acosta’s Fifth Amendment right to due process by suspending his press badge without explanation or a chance for CNN to appeal the decision.
 Kelly said White House officials couldn’t say who made the decision or how.
 The judge ordered the government to restore the credential while the rest of the case – which drew a slew of support from other media outlets, including USA TODAY – is argued.
 “This court cannot restore Mr. Acosta’s access to press briefings that have already been held,” Kelly said.
 But Kelly said he hasn’t considered at all yet whether the White House violated Acosta’s First Amendment rights.
 More arguments are expected Tuesday.
 “I trust this litigation will continue at a rapid pace.” Kelly said.
 What?
 Due process?
 Wait, Acosta was not charged with a crime.
 Neither his property, liberty nor his life was taken.
 There is no due process here.

 The Fifth Amendment has no business being brought up here.
 This is an issue of privilege, not rights.
 I have made this point before and this judge apparently doesn't get it.
 I want my White House press pass!
 So does Infowars.
 Will Judge Kelly demand the White House provide us with one as a ""right""?
 Nope, not gonna happen.
 Because it's not a right.
 Yet, this judge orders the White House to restore the credentials?
 Give me a break!
 Acosta's First Amendment rights weren't violated either.
 Furthermore, the White House did say they were willing to have another reporter in to the White House press from CNN, but that just wasn't good enough.
 CNN tweeted: ""Statement from CNN and @ Acosta on today’s ruling: “We are gratified with this result and we look forward to a full resolution in the coming days.
 Our sincere thanks to all who have supported not just CNN, but a free, strong and independent American press.”

 More like a strong, lying, propagandizing press, right CNN?
 President Trump responded to the order.
 He told Fox News' Chris Wallace, ""Yeah, its fine, I mean it’s not a big deal.
 What they said, though, is that we have to create rules and regulations for conduct etc.
 etc.
 We’re doing that, were going to write them up right now.
 It’s not a big deal and if he misbehaves, we’ll throw him out or we’ll stop the news conference.""
 In speaking about the rules and regulations the White House is writing up, Trump added, ""We’re writing them now.
 We’ll have rules of decorum, you know you can’t keep asking questions.
 We had a lot of reporters in that room, many many reporters in that room and they were unable to ask questions because this guy gets up and starts, you know, doing what he’s supposed to be doing for him and for CNN and you know just shouting out questions and making statements, too.""
 You know that isn't going to stop someone like Acosta, who claimed to deal in facts and truth, but clearly demonstrated he was all about lies when it came to putting his hands on a White House aide.
 The order by Judge Kelly is a temporary one that lasts for 14 days.
 “I will say this, look, nobody believes in the First Amendment more than I do and if I think somebody is acting out of sorts I will leave,"" Trump continued.
 ""I will say thank you very much everybody, I appreciate you coming and I’ll leave.
 And those reporters will not be too friendly to whoever it is that’s acting up.”
 White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders issued a statement following the judge's ruling on Thursday.
 “Today, the court made clear that there is no absolute First Amendment right to access the White House.
 In response to the court, we will temporarily reinstate the reporter’s hard pass.
 We will also further develop rules and processes to ensure fair and orderly press conferences in the future.
 There must be decorum at the White House.”
 Well, I can't wait to see the next press conference.
 Perhaps there is an easier way around all of this.
 Perhaps from now on, President Trump should ignore Jim Acosta and take anyone and everyone else's questions in the room but his questions.
 See how he likes them apples.

"Not Surprising: Now Fox News Is Supporting CNN & Jim Acosta
 
 Fox News is largely controlled opposition despite what many may think.
 They have a couple of people that actually are conservative.
 Other than that, they have liberals and neo-cons running rampant.
 Many were surprised to discover that Fox News not only is supporting lying CNN and lying Jim Acosta, but they are even going so far as to file an amicus brief with the US district court over the White House's revoking of Acosta's press pass.
 One would think these people would understand that this is not a First Amendment issue.
 If it were, they wouldn't have to apply for a White House press pass.
 This is a privilege issue and it seems that Acosta wore out his welcome with his attacks on Sarah Sanders, being belligerent during his time asking a question(s) of President Donald Trump, and his pushing aside a White House aide who simply tried to remove the microphone from him.
 Trump was right, Acosta is a ""rude, terrible person.""

 However, the cable news channel is showing more and more that it is not fair and balanced and is far from what conservatives think it is as it blasted the White House about not giving little Jimmy his press pass back.
 In a statement by Fox News President Jay Wallace, he wrote:
 “Fox News supports CNN in its legal effort to regain its White House reporter’s press credential.
 We intend to file an amicus brief with the U.S. District Court.
 Secret Service passes for working White House journalists should never be weaponized.
 While we don’t condone the growing antagonistic tone by both the president and the press at recent media avails, we do support a free press, access and open exchanges for the American people.""
 So, file it!
 On the basis of what, Mr. Wallace?
 The free press still exists, and you know what?
 Jim Acosta and CNN continue to lie, just like they have for decades, and here's the proof.
 Look how they doctored the video to not show what clearly took place and then lied about it, and I suppose Fox falls right in line with that behavior.
 So, Fox joins with the least trusted name in news, the Clown News Network, to go after the White House on something that is the White House's prerogative and claim it's about free press.
 It's not.
 Fox reported:
 The White House Correspondents’ Association – of which Fox News is a member – issued a statement in support of CNN’s decision to take legal action.
 “We continue to urge the administration to reverse course and fully reinstate CNN’s correspondent,” WHCA President Olivier Knox said.
 “The President of the United States should not be in the business of arbitrarily picking the men and women who cover him.” However, several prominent media members – such as Pulitzer Prize-winning Watergate journalist Bob Woodward – have criticized CNN over the lawsuit.
 As they should.
 It's frivolous, but because they are immature children over at CNN, it's not surprising, and frankly, it's no surprise coming from Fox either.
 White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders called the CNN lawsuit ""grandstanding.""
 I wonder what she will call the amicus brief from Fox.
 ""This is just more grandstanding from CNN, and we will vigorously defend against this lawsuit,” Sanders said.
 “CNN, who has nearly 50 additional hard pass holders, and Mr. Acosta is no more or less special than any other media outlet or reporter with respect to the First Amendment.
 After Mr. Acosta asked the President two questions — each of which the President answered — he physically refused to surrender a White House microphone to an intern, so that other reporters might ask their questions.
 This was not the first time this reporter has inappropriately refused to yield to other reporters.”
 Of course, CNN was thrilled as Fox more than likely helped them grow a little in ratings by issuing support.
 The propaganda outlet tweeted out Fox's statement.
 Fox News will file an amicus brief in support of @Acosta and CNN.
 Thank you @FoxNews!

 Here's the thing, if it is a right to have a press pass to the White House, where is mine?
 and yours?
 How about Infowars?
 See?
 It isn't a right and Fox News just pulled the mask off, people.
 Do you see who they really are now?
 If not, I can't help you.

"Court orders White House to restore CNN correspondent Jim Acosta’s press credential
 
 CNN has won the first round of its legal battle to get correspondent Jim Acosta back in the White House.
 U.S. District Court Judge Timothy Kelly granted the cable news network’s request for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction Friday that restored Acosta’s White House press credential.
 Kelly ordered that Acosta be reinstated immediately.
 He did not rule on CNN’s claim that the revocation of the journalist’s pass violated his rights under the First Amendment.
 But he said the White House did not provide Acosta with due process to legally remove his pass.
 The ruling followed a court hearing held Wednesday in Washington, where lawyers for CNN and the White House faced off over the issue of press access.
 CNN had the broad support of other news organizations that believed the White House’s actions posed a challenge to press freedom.
 “We are gratified with this result and we look forward to a full resolution in the coming days,” a CNN representative said in a statement.
 “Our sincere thanks to all who have supported not just CNN, but a free, strong and independent American press.”
 The White House said it would abide by Kelly’s ruling.
 “Today, the court made clear there is no absolute right to access the White House.
 In response to the court, we will temporarily reinstate the reporter’s hard pass,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement.
 “We will also further develop rules and processes to ensure fair and orderly press conferences in the future.
 There must be decorum in the White House.”
 Acosta’s press credential was revoked by the White House on Nov. 7 after a testy exchange with President Donald Trump at a White House news conference.
 At one point, Acosta refused to relinquish the microphone to a White House aide who tried to retrieve it from him.
 It was the latest in a series of public confrontations between Acosta and Trump, who has repeatedly characterized CNN’s critical coverage of him as “fake news” since the 2016 presidential campaign.
 CNN’s suit filed Tuesday says the suspension of Acosta’s credential violates the First Amendment’s protection of free speech.
 It also says the way the administration revoked the pass, with no direct notice to Acosta or a written explanation detailing the decision, violated the Fifth Amendment’s protection of due process and the federal Administrative Procedures Act.
 “This severe and unprecedented punishment is the culmination of years of hostility by President Trump against CNN and Acosta based on the contents of their reporting — an unabashed attempt to censor the press and exclude reporters from the White House who challenge and dispute the president’s point of view,” the suit says.
 Responding to the CNN suit, lawyers for the White House said the Trump administration had broad discretion to regulate access to journalists and other members of the public.
 “If the president wants to exclude all reporters from the White House grounds, he has the authority to do that,” Deputy Assistant Attorney General James Burnham said during the hearing.
 “There’s no First Amendment right.”
 The White House argued that Acosta’s behavior, which it described as rude and aggressive, was the reason for revoking his credential.
 Mark Lukasiewicz, dean of The Lawrence Herbert School of Communication at Hofstra University and a former network news executive, praised the judge’s decision, which he said was not a surprise.
 “The White House has lots of other ways to deal with the behavior of reporters if that’s their concern, but closing the gate to a news organization is not one of these ways, and it’s important that the court stood up and said that,” Lukasiewicz said.
 “It’s not the first time a reporter has behaved in a way that a president doesn’t like.”
 Lukasiewicz believed CNN would reach a compromise with the White House rather than engage in a prolonged court battle.
 “The law and the Constitution is very clear here,” he said.
 CNN’s suit received the support of more than a dozen news organizations including Fox News, where commentators have often echoed Trump’s criticisms of the network’s coverage.
 Rival news organizations came to the defense of Fox News in 2009 when the Obama administration attempted to exclude its reporters from interviews with officials that were offered to all other outlets.
 Fox News commentators were President Barack Obama’s harshest critics during his eight years in office, and he often complained about it in public and private.
 But the press credentials for its conservative-leaning network were never revoked.
 Fox News, The Washington Post, NBC News, The Associated Press and the Los Angeles Times are among the entities that have said they will file amicus briefs on behalf of CNN.

"Trump Vows to Kick CNN’s Acosta Out Again
 
 President Trump took CNN’s improbable court victory temporarily restoring CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta’s “hard pass” media credential for the executive mansion in stride, vowing to kick Acosta out again in the future if he breaches White House protocol again.
 The yanking of the physical credential, by the way, isn’t exactly a grave hardship.
 It just means Acosta would need to make an appointment through the White House press office every time he wanted to visit the White House grounds, just as the rest of the non-hard pass-holding journalists who don’t work for big media outlets like CNN have to do.
 Lacking a hard pass does not prevent anyone from reporting on the White House.
 Speaking to Chris Wallace of Fox News Channel in an interview that aired Sunday, Trump had some new ideas on how to deal with Acosta, who picks fights with him during pressers.
 ""I think one of the things we’ll do is maybe turn the camera off that faces them, because then they don’t have any air time, although I’ll probably be sued for that and maybe, you know, win or lose it, who knows,"" Trump said.
 ""I mean, with this stuff you never know what’s going to happen.""
 The president described Acosta as ""unbelievably rude to [White House Press Secretary] Sarah Huckabee, who’s a wonderful woman,"" and said his administration is drawing up ""rules and regulations"" for White House reporters.
 ""And if he misbehaves, we’ll throw him out or we’ll stop the news conference,"" Trump said.
 Acosta’s hard pass was pulled after a contentious Nov. 7 press conference at the White House.
 After interacting with President Trump – Acosta said he wanted to “challenge” him on calling the Central American caravans an “invasion” – the president called upon another reporter to speak.
 After lecturing Trump, Acosta belligerently refused to yield the microphone to a White House staffer and pushed her arm away as she reached for the device, all of which was captured on video.
 On Nov. 16, U.S. District Judge Timothy J. Kelly of Washington, D.C., who was appointed by Trump, ruled against the administration and ordered Acosta’s hard pass restored for 14 days, pending further hearings in the lawsuit.
 But it was not a vindication of Acosta’s free speech rights under the First Amendment.
 The judge specifically said that the First Amendment claim made by Acosta and CNN had not yet been adjudicated and added that the president was free not to call on Acosta at future press conferences.
 The temporary restraining order was nowhere to be found online at press time, but according to media reports, Kelly found that the administration violated Acosta’s due process rights under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.
 The White House vowed to remedy the situation by drawing up rules governing press conferences.
 The U.S. Department of Justice said the court ruling was disappointing.
 “The President has broad authority to regulate access to the White House, including to ensure fair and orderly White House events and press conferences.
 We look forward to continuing to defend the White House's lawful actions.""
 Acosta ignorantly blathered on to reporters when he returned to the White House Friday after the court ruling, incorrectly claiming he won a great First Amendment victory.
 ""I'm very grateful for what happened today,"" Acosta said.
 ""I'm grateful for my colleagues in the press who stood by us through all of this.""
 ""This was a test and I think we passed the test,"" he said.
 ""Journalists need to know that in this country their First Amendment rights of freedom of the press are sacred, they're protected in our Constitution,"" Acosta said.
 ""Throughout all of this I was confident and I thought that this would be the result at the end of the day that our rights would be protected as we continue to cover our government and hold our leaders accountable.""
 The court case isn’t over yet.
 The legal antagonists have to report to the court Monday afternoon.
 The court ordered the parties to “file a joint status report proposing how they would like to proceed in this case by 3:00 p.m. on November 19, 2018[,]” according to its online docket.
 According to CNN, “White House officials sent Acosta a letter stating that his pass is set to be suspended again once the restraining order expires.”
 From the looks of the letter, the W.H.
 is trying to establish a paper trail that will empower the administration to boot Acosta again at the end of the month.
 CNN responded with this statement on Sunday: ""The White House is continuing to violate the First and 5th Amendments of the Constitution.
 These actions threaten all journalists and news organizations.
 Jim Acosta and CNN will continue to report the news about the White House and the President.""
 The Acosta-CNN lawsuit was filed by Ted Boutrous and Trump-hating Republican lawyer Ted Olson, of the law firm Gibson, Dunn, and Crutcher.
 Olson was solicitor general in President George W. Bush’s administration.
 (The legal complaint may be viewed here.)
 Boutrous said CNN is prepared to dig in for a protracted legal fight if it needs to.
 ""We're ready to litigate as long as we have to, to protect these First Amendment rights, to ask the court to declare rules of the road going forward,"" he said.
