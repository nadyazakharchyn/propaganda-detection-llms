"Пишет Елена Лаваль (Донецк). ================== Сейчас соберу в кучу дрожащие руки и кишащие в голове мысли и все - таки напишу.... На Украине у нас самые дорогие в мире люди. Все мысли только о них. Мне не хотелось, чтобы все пришло к тому, к чему пришло. Никому из донецких не хотелось. Напомнить вам, рыбки золотые, как мы умоляли, уговаривали, упрашивали вас опомниться на вашем вонючем майдане? Напомнить, что вы отвечали, выкалывая с азартом глаза мальчишкам- полицейским ? Над сожженными в Одессе не хотите посмеяться сейчас? Над светлым, чистым, юным Вадиком Папурой, которого с вашего согласия живьем сожгли бандеровские ублюдки? Как думаете сейчас, ему не было страшно? Вы не плюнули в рожи мразям типа Порошенко, Яценюка и Турчинова. Вы им пирожки носили. Не носили? Ожидаемо. Но мы же предупреждали, мы просили!!! Мы у вас были даунами, орками, алкашами и ублюдками. Нет? Да! Вчера читала призывы к донецким женщинам выйти на пл. Ленина и выступить против войны. Нам не нужно выходить: мы - против.. Когда нас 8 долбанных лет месили градами, вы, конечно же, выходили на ваш майдан и кричали: Порошенко, Зеленский, прекрати. Да? Нет? Нас и сейчас месят ВСУ, вот прямо сейчас, от злости, от бессилия, от понимания конца. Вы уже на площадях? Вас не бомбят. И очень надеюсь, бомбить не будут. Вы просто услышали непривычные звуки и затряслись от страха, что ваши шкурки полиняют, попки свалятся с удобных стульчиков. Хорошо, что вы поняли, что такое - страх войны. Мы 8 лет в нем живем. Вы даже жертв этой жуткой войны умудрились присвоить. 15 тысяч! 15, блин, тысяч убито из-за вас. А сколько погибло от рака, инфарктов и инсультов от многолетнего стресса? Но мы же орки, нас не жаль. Мой младший сын сказал вчера, что мы - православные, нельзя желать кому-то погибели. Боже, сохрани от этого! Донбасс, даже в этом своем катастрофическом положении, все эти годы сочувствовал вашим бедам. А вы? Вы глумились над телами разорванных донецких детей и женщин, над бедой, которую сами нам принесли. Ваши ""воины света"" отражали ""российскую навалу"" все 8 лет. Самая сильная армия Европы грудью кого-то сдерживала. Мы кричали: здесь нет России!!!! Вы смеялись и слали нам снаряды с надписью ""Детям Донбасса"". И не стеснялись выкладывать свои видео об этом. Не помните? Это понятно. Ваши воины ""света "" еще вчера бахвалились, что ""будут резать животы русне"". И? Так что же сейчас? Что для вас изменилось? Отражайте. Или вы врали всем и даже себе о России? Вы врали. Вы подлые, трусливые, гнусные. Вы угробили страну, красивую, добрую, цветущую. Непривычные звуки у вас скоро стихнут, но бояться вы, причастные ко всему, что происходит, будете всю вашу жалкую жизнь. Не за людей угробленных, за шкуры свои бандеровские будете переживать. Знаете, мне вас не жаль. Почувствуйте атмосферу, которую вы нам создали. И себе. Рвите теперь свои волосы во всех местах. Удачи!

"#РусскийШепот  Евгений из Израиля. Израиль, так же как и Россия, окружен враждебными странами. Израиль затеил несколько воин , чтоб отбить у соседей желание конфликтовать. Да и до сих пор, между прочим , нарушая международные ""правила"" , уничтожает в соседних странах любую военную технику, которая может в обозримом будущем создать опасность Израилю. Я полностью поддерживаю право России на защиту своей безопасности. Здравствуйте, Андрей Андреевич! Я из Челябинска, мне 18 лет, учусь в 11 классе . Хорошо помню ещё события 2014 года, когда 10-летним ходил на митинг поддержки русской весны. С тех пор ждал тех событий, которые разворачиваются сегодня. Уже успел получить гневные отповеди с переходом на личности от многих ""друзей"", которым, видимо, жизни нацистских преступников дороже жизней мирных жителей Донбасса. Так как являюсь представителем молодёжи, могу сказать, что сейчас мы условно разделены на 3 категории: тех, кто относительно активно поддерживает действия наших ребят, нейтральных (их большинство) и тех, кто пишет ""нет войне"", извиняется за русских, ставит в профиль флаг Украины. Отмечу, что последних немного, но они очень активны, заряжены на дискуссии. Полагаю, что сегодня нам нужно как можно более доступно объяснить молодёжи, ради чего там воюют наши воины. Поверьте, многие, кому покажешь видео с убитыми детьми Донбасса, осознают необходимость операции; это проверено на личном опыте. У органов молодёжной политики на данный момент нет чёткого курса на акции в поддержку нашей армии: всё ограничивается лишь волонтёрством для беженцев (что тоже важно), никакого продуманного патриотического дискурса для молодёжи в связи с этими событиями нет. Возможно, Вам удастся как-то повлиять на эту ситуацию. Вячеслав. Здравствуйте Андрей.Я из Казахстана.Мне 29 лет. Я дитя независимости.И мне бы сейчас,как говорится,""топить"" за,так называемые, ""западные ценности"" кои мне прививали с детства,но я ни за что не буду этого делать.Потому что я никогда не приму ни их ""ценности"",ни их ""демократию"".Мне прививали ценности моих предков.Я-потомок солдата, победившего фашистов.

Признаюсь, не ожидал от руководства такой решимости (где она была все 8 лет?) и таких уверенных слов и действий. Ещё в 2014 году был очень рад воссоединению с Крымом и надеялся, что этим не ограничится, но вышло как вышло. У украины не может быть судьбы, отдельной от России! С этим не смирится ни одно правительство на территории России! Вся история и последние события доказывают это. А Россия наконец-то, кажется, возвращается к своей судьбе, на свой путь развития.

"Swedish PM does not rule out use of army to end gang violence
 
 Sweden will do whatever it takes, including sending in the army, to end a wave of gang violence that has seen a string of deadly shootings, Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said in Wednesday.
 Sweden’s murder rate is relatively low in international terms, but gang violence has surged in recent years and Swedes are worried that the police are unable to cope.
 In 2016, the latest year for which official statistics are available, 106 people were murdered in Sweden, a country of 10 million.
 
 But Swedish TV reported there were over 300 shootings, mostly in turf battles between gangs over drugs, protection rackets and prostitution.
 Four people were shot dead in the first week of this year.
 One man died after picking up a hand grenade outside a subway station in a suburb of Stockholm.
 
 Law and order is likely to be a major issue in a parliamentary election scheduled for September with the populist, opposition Sweden Democrats linking public concern about the rising crime rate to a large increase in the numbers of immigrants.
 
 “It would not be my first option to bring in the military, but I am prepared to do whatever is necessary to make sure that serious, organized crime is stamped out,” Lofven told news agency TT.
 
 The government has promised police an extra 7.1 billion crowns ($880 million) through 2020, toughened laws on gun crimes and made it easier for the police to monitor private phone calls and emails, among other measures.
 
 But a report by the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention shows increasing numbers of Swedes worried about crime with confidence falling in the police and the judicial system.
 
 “People are shot to death in pizza restaurants, people are killed by hand grenades they find on the street,” Sweden Democrat leader Jimmie Akesson said in parliament on Wednesday.
 
 “This is the new Sweden; the new, exciting dynamic, multicultural paradise that so many here in this assembly ... have fought to create for so many years,” he said sarcastically.

"Israel Takes On the Shia Crescent
 
 Despite Israel's repeated warnings, Barack Obama's reckless appeasement of the Iranian regime has enabled its rise as a hegemonic threat in the Middle East region as well as a threat to international peace and security.
 In 2009, Obama turned his back on millions of dissidents in the streets of Tehran and other Iranian cities, who were peacefully protesting the rigged election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as president.
 In 2011, Obama precipitously removed the remaining U.S. combat troops from Iraq, giving rise to ISIS’s re-emergence in Iraq from its bases in Syria.
 The radical Shiite Iranian regime purported to come to the “rescue” of both countries from the Sunni terrorists, turning Iraq into a virtual vassal state of the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the process.
 Obama's disastrous nuclear deal with Iran legitimized Iran's path to eventually becoming a nuclear-armed state, while immediately filling its coffers with billions of dollars to fund its aggression.
 Meanwhile, Syria has become ground zero for Iran's execution of its regional ambitions, which is to establish its Shiite Crescent connecting with its allies, including Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.
 This plan has included the establishment of a land route that Iranian-backed militias secured in June, beginning on Iran’s border with Iraq and running across Iraq and Syria all the way to Syria’s Mediterranean coast.
 This road makes Iran’s job easier in supplying arms by land, as well as by air and sea, to prop up Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime and to equip Iran’s own forces fighting inside of Syria in support of Assad.
 This helps explain why Iran has placed so much importance on helping the Syrian regime establish control over the Deir ez-Zor area in eastern Syria, near the Iraqi border.
 “Everything depends now on the Americans’ willingness to stop this,” said an Iraqi Kurdish official who was quoted in a New Yorker article.
 However, U.S.-led coalition forces apparently have done next to nothing to stop this major advance in Iran’s Shiite Crescent expansion.
 “Obama ran down our options in Syria so thoroughly, by the time this administration took over,” said Andrew Tabler, senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
 “The Iranian influence is spreading because they are so heavily involved in regime activities,” Tabler added.
 “It’s a new monster.”
 Furthermore, Iran has funded and armed its terrorist proxy Hezbollah, which has sent its militia from its home base of Lebanon to fight alongside Assad's forces.
 And Iran has used Syria as a transit point for shipment of sophisticated rockets to Hezbollah in Lebanon for future use against Israeli population centers.
 Despite the fact that Hezbollah has American blood on its hands, the U.S.-led coalition has chosen not to do anything about Hezbollah’s presence in Syria, bought and paid for by Iran.
 While Israel chose not to take sides in Syria's civil war with military intervention of its own, it has bombed weapons storage facilities and convoys inside Syria for its own protection.
 Just recently, on September 7th, Israeli jets struck a Syrian weapons facility near Masyaf, which was reported to have been used for the production of chemical weapons and the storage of missiles.
 Israel will also do what is necessary to repel Iranian-backed forces if they edge too close to areas near the Golan Heights, shrinking the buffer between Israel and Iranian controlled territories.
 However, such tactical measures may not be enough to thwart Iran’s larger ambitions.
 In light of intelligence reports that Assad may be ready to invite Iran to set up military bases in Syria, Israeli leaders have concluded that they cannot wait until the Trump administration decides to deal more forcefully with Iran's growing use of Syria as a staging area for carrying out its expansionist Shiite Crescent strategy.
 “Their overriding concern in Syria is the free reign that all the major players there seem willing to afford Iran and its various proxies in the country,” wrote Jonathan Spyer in an article for Foreign Policy.
 As long as nobody else is addressing the concern Iran’s growing control raises in a satisfactory manner, “Israel is determined to continue addressing it on its own.”
 At least, Israel has a more sympathetic ear in the Trump administration than it did in the Obama administration for raising its concerns about Iran’s growing threat, not only to Israel but to U.S. interests in the region and beyond.
 President Trump’s sharp denunciation of the Iranian regime during his address to the UN General Assembly represented a welcome departure from the Obama administration’s milquetoast approach to Iran.
 As the U.S.-led coalition continues to drive ISIS from its bases of operation in Syria, the Trump administration has proclaimed its intention not to allow Iran to turn Syria into its own satellite, as Iran has essentially done in Iraq.
 National Security Adviser H.R.
 McMaster said that the “so called liberation of areas by Assad’s forces and Iranian proxies could actually accelerate the cycle of violence and perpetuate conflict rather than get us to a sustainable outcome.” He claimed that the Trump administration’s “objectives are to weaken Iranian influence across the region broadly,” without discussing the means to accomplish those objectives.
 Whether the Trump administration follows through remains to be seen.
 In the meantime, Israel will have to deal with the fallout of Iran’s ambitions in Syria itself.

"FBI Informant “Threatened” After Offering Details Linking Clinton Foundation To Russian Bribery Case
 
 This report was originally published by Tyler Durden at Zero Hedge
 While the mainstream media has largely ignored it, the scandal surrounding Russian efforts to acquire 20% of America’s uranium reserves, a deal which was ultimately approved by the Obama administration, and more specifically the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) which included Hillary Clinton and Eric Holder, is becoming more problematic for Democrats by the hour.
 As The Hill pointed out earlier this morning, the latest development in this sordid tale revolves around a man that the FBI used as an informant back in 2009 and beyond to build a case against a Russian perpetrator who ultimately admitted to bribery, extortion and money laundering.
 The informant, who is so far only known as “Confidential Source 1,” says that when he attempted to come forward last year with information that linked the Clinton Foundation directly to the scandal he was promptly silenced by the FBI and the Obama administration.
 Working as a confidential witness, the businessman made kickback payments to the Russians with the approval of his FBI handlers and gathered other evidence, the records show.
 Sources told The Hill the informant’s work was crucial to the government’s ability to crack a multimillion dollar racketeering scheme by Russian nuclear officials on U.S. soil that involved bribery, kickbacks, money laundering and extortion.
 In the end, the main Russian executive sent to the U.S. to expand Russian President Vladimir Putin’s nuclear business, an executive of an American trucking firm and a Russian financier from New Jersey pled guilty to various crimes in a case that started in 2009 and ended in late 2015.
 Toensing added her client has had contact from multiple congressional committees seeking information about what he witnessed inside the Russian nuclear industry and has been unable to provide that information because of the NDA.
 “He can’t disclose anything that he came upon in the course of his work,” she said.
 The information the client possesses includes specific allegations that Russian executives made to him about how they facilitated the Obama administration’s 2010 approval of the Uranium One deal and sent millions of dollars in Russian nuclear funds to the U.S. to an entity assisting Bill Clinton’s foundation.
 At the time, Hillary Clinton was serving as secretary of State on the government panel that approved the deal, the lawyer said.
 It has been previously reported that Bill Clinton accepted $500,000 in Russian speaking fees in 2010 and collected millions more in donations for his foundation from parties with a stake in the Uranium One deal, transactions that both the Clintons and the Obama administration denied had any influence on the approval.
 In the midst of the new discoveries revealed yesterday about the Uranium One case (see: FBI Uncovered Russian Bribery Plot Before Obama Approved Uranium One Deal, Netting Clintons Millions), “Confidential Source 1” has once again hired an attorney, Victoria Toensing, a former Reagan Justice Department official and former chief counsel of the Senate Intelligence Committee, to get his story out.
 Sitting down with The Hill earlier, Toensing said that the last time her client tried to speak out “both his reputation and liberty” were “threatened” by the Obama administration in a effort to force his silence.
 “All of the information about this corruption has not come out,” she said in an interview Tuesday.
 “And so my client, the same part of my client that made him go into the FBI in the first place, says, ‘This is wrong.
 What should I do about it?’”
 Toensing said she also possesses memos that recount how the Justice Department last year threatened her client when he attempted to file a lawsuit that could have drawn attention to the Russian corruption during the 2016 presidential race as well as helped him recover some of the money Russians stole from him through kickbacks during the FBI probe.
 The undercover client witnessed “a lot of bribery going on around the U.S.” but was asked by the FBI to sign a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) that prevents him from revealing what he knows to Congress, Toensing explained.
 When he tried to bring some of the allegations to light in the lawsuit last year, “the Obama Justice Department threatened him with loss of freedom.
 They said they would bring a criminal case against him for violating an NDA,” she added.
 Emails obtained by The Hill show that a civil attorney working with the former undercover witness described the pressure the Justice Department exerted to keep the client from disclosing to a federal court what he knew last summer.
 “The government was taking a very harsh position that threatened both your reputation and liberty,” the civil lawyer wrote in one email.
 In another, she added, “As you will recall the gov’t made serious threats sufficient to cause you to withdraw your civil complaint.”
 As we pointed out last summer when Peter Schweizer first released his feature documentary Clinton Cash, the Uranium One deal at the center of this scandal is believed to have netted the Clintons and their Clinton Foundation millions of dollars in donations and ‘speaking fees’ from Uranium One shareholders and other Russian entities.
 Russian Purchase of US Uranium Assets in Return for $145mm in Contributions to the Clinton Foundation – Bill and Hillary Clinton assisted a Canadian financier, Frank Giustra, and his company, Uranium One, in the acquisition of uranium mining concessions in Kazakhstan and the United States.
 Subsequently, the Russian government sought to purchase Uranium One but required approval from the Obama administration given the strategic importance of the uranium assets.
 In the run-up to the approval of the deal by the State Department, nine shareholders of Uranium One just happened to make $145mm in donations to the Clinton Foundation.
 Moreover, the New Yorker confirmed that Bill Clinton received $500,000 in speaking fees from a Russian investment bank, with ties to the Kremlin, around the same time.
 Needless to say, the State Department approved the deal giving Russia ownership of 20% of U.S. uranium assets.
 Meanwhile, the ‘journalists’ over at CNN are still trying to get to the bottom of exactly who spent the $100,000 on Facebook ads…

"America's Immigration Voice.
 
 The Kurds have no friends but the mountains, is an old lament .
 Last week, it must have been very much on Kurdish minds.
 As their U.S. allies watched, the Kurdish peshmerga fighters were run out of Kirkuk and all the territory they had captured fighting ISIS alongside the Americans.
 The Iraqi army that ran them out was trained and armed by the United States.
 The U.S. had warned the Kurds against holding the referendum on independence on Sept. 25, which carried with 92 percent.
 Iran and Turkey had warned against an independent Kurdistan that could be a magnet for Kurdish minorities in their own countries.
 But the Iraqi Kurds went ahead.
 Now they have lost Kirkuk and its oil, and their dream of independence is all but dead.
 More troubling for America is the new reality revealed by the rout of the peshmerga.
 Iraq, which George W. Bush and the neocons were going to fashion into a pro-Western democracy and American ally, appears to be as close to Iran as it is to the United States.
 After 4,500 U.S. dead, scores of thousands wounded and a trillion dollars sunk, our 15-year war in Iraq could end with a Shiite-dominated Baghdad aligned with Tehran.
 With that grim prospect in mind, Secretary Rex Tillerson said Sunday , ""Iranian militias that are in Iraq, now that the fight against ... ISIS is coming to a close ... need to go home.
 Any foreign fighters in Iraq need to go home.""
 Tillerson meant Iran's Quds Force in Iraq should go home, and the Shiite militia in Iraq should be conscripted into the army.
 But what if the Baghdad regime of Haider al-Abadi does not agree?
 What if the Quds Force does not go home to Iran and the Shiite militias that helped retake Kirkuk refuse to enlist in the Iraqi army?
 Who then enforces Tillerson's demands?
 Consider what is happening in Syria.
 The U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, largely Kurdish, just annihilated ISIS in Raqqa and drove 60 miles to seize Syria's largest oil field, al-Omar, from ISIS.
 The race is now on between the SDF and Bashar Assad's army to secure the border with Iraq.
 Bottom line: The U.S. goal of crushing the ISIS caliphate is almost attained.
 But if our victory in the war against ISIS leaves Iran in the catbird seat in Baghdad and Damascus, and its corridor from Tehran to Baghdad, Damascus and Beirut secure, is that really a victory?
 Do we accept that outcome, pack up and go home?
 Or do we leave our forces in Syria and Iraq and defy any demand from Assad to vacate his country?
 Sunday's editorial in The Washington Post, ""The Next Mideast Wars,"" raises the crucial questions now before us.
 Would President Trump be willing to fight a new war to keep Iran from consolidating its position in Iraq and Syria?
 Would the American people support such a war with U.S. troops?
 Would Congress, apparently clueless to the presence of 800 U.S. troops in Niger, authorize a new U.S. war in Syria or Iraq?
 If Trump and his generals felt our vital interests could not allow Syria and Iraq to drift into the orbit of Iran, where would we find allies for such a fight?
 If we rely on the Kurds in Syria, we lose NATO ally Turkey, which regards Syria's Kurds as collaborators of the PKK in Turkey, which even the U.S. designates a terrorist organization.
 The decision as to whether this country should engage in new post-ISIS wars in the Mideast, however, may be taken out of our hands.
 Saturday, Israel launched new air strikes against gun positions in Syria in retaliation for shells fired into the Golan Heights.
 Damascus claims that Israel's ""terrorist"" allies inside Syria fired the shells, to give the IDF an excuse to attack.
 Why would Israel wish to provoke a war with Syria?
 Because the Israelis see the outcome of the six-year Syrian civil war as a strategic disaster.
 Hezbollah, stronger than ever, was part of Assad's victorious coalition.
 Iran may have secured its land corridor from Tehran to Beirut.
 Its presence in Syria could now be permanent.
 And only one force in the region has the power to reverse the present outcome of Syria's civil war--the United States.
 Bibi Netanyahu knows that if war with Syria breaks out, a clamor will arise in Congress to have the U.S. rush to Israel's aid.
 ""A failure by the United States to defend its allies or promote new political arrangements for (Syria and Iraq) will lead only to more war, the rise of new terrorist threats, and, ultimately, the necessity of more U.S.
 intervention.""
 Closing its Sunday editorial the Post instructed the president:The interventionist Post is saying: The situation is intolerable.
 Confront Assad and Iran now, or fight them later.
 Trump is being led to the Rubicon.
 If he crosses, he joins Bush II in the history books.

"ICE removes Guatemalan national wanted for murder
 
 NEW YORK — U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) removed a Guatemalan citizen Wednesday who was wanted in his home country on charges of homicide.
 Rigoberto Gonzalez-Aragon, 66, was returned to Guatemala City, via an ICE Air Operations charter flight, and transferred to the custody of Guatemalan law enforcement authorities.
 On March 9, ERO New York received a lead from the ICE Assistant Attaché for Removals in Guatemala that Gonzalez-Aragon was wanted for homicide and residing in the New York metropolitan area.
 On June 8, ERO deportation officers arrested Gonzalez-Aragon in Spring Valley, New York, for immigration violations.
 He had previously entered the country unlawfully at an unknown date and time.
 He had been in ICE custody since his June arrest.
 In September, he was ordered removed by an immigration judge, paving the way for his deportation.
 Since Oct. 1, 2009, ERO has removed more than 1,700 foreign fugitives from the United States who were sought in their native countries for serious crimes, including kidnapping, rape and murder.
 In fiscal year 2016, ICE conducted 240,255 removals nationwide.
 Ninety-two percent of individuals removed from the interior of the United States had previously been convicted of a criminal offense.

"Uranium One Bombshell: Evidence of Bribery, Extortion, Kickbacks, Money Laundering, and More!
 
 Right about now the people in the Clinton camp should be getting very nervous about the ongoing investigations into the Uranium One deal.
 What must be most annoying for the Clinton team is that these investigations all started as a way to undermine the Trump administration and continue to push connections between Trump and Russia.
 Now, more than a year after the investigations began, it’s looking less likely than ever that President Trump did anything wrong… but the investigations seem to be zeroing in on key Clinton team members (including the Clintons themselves).
 On Tuesday night Fox News Sean Hannity sat down to talk about the exploding scandal that is the Uranium One deal, and what it could mean for the Clinton family.
 Hannity spoke with investigative reporter Sara Carter of Circa, John Solomon of The Hill, and Victoria Toensing, an attorney representing the FBI informant who allegedly possesses documents on the sale of Canadian mining company ‘Uranium One’ to Russia interests back in 2010.
 Now that the NDA (non disclosure agreement) has been lifted Circa’s Sara Carter is “reporting that she has received a treasure trove of documents that in fact prove tonight the FBI informant has knowledge of Russia’s involvement in uranium one.”
 Not to be outdone, the Hill’s John Solomon had found even more dirt on this ugly Clinton led deal.
 Apparently, Solomon has learned that the FBI informant “has evidence, was on the inside, directly from Putin’s Russia, the push for nuclear fuel deals, and all the crimes we talked about, bribery, kickback, extortion, money laundering, racketeering, all knelt corroborating and will be corroborated even further.
 Go into your report.”
 This is all about to get very ugly.
 https://youtu.be/_DFeri21hlc
 HANNITY: Breaking news tonight, the Hills John Solomon, investigative reporter Sara Carter, they released bombshell reports equally tonight.
 Solomon reporting according to the memos obtained, the FBI informant that now has had his NDA lifted at the center of this case gathered years and years of evidence of Russia’s plot to control U.S. Nuclear fuel, which included the uranium one deal.
 And Sara Carter reporting that she has received a treasure trove of documents that in fact prove tonight the FBI informant has knowledge of Russia’s involvement in uranium one.
 Also joining us now is the attorney for the FBI informant, Victoria Toensing along with John and Sara.
 Sara, let’s start with your report.
 A treasure trove, that is huge.
 SARAH CARTER, CIRCA NEWS: It is Sean.
 I mean there’s over 5,000 documents which include emails, briefs, other documentation, memorandums that the informant had turned over to the FBI and Justice Department, and within these documents, it’s very evident of Russia’s intention to enter the American market, energy market.
 And their intentions to acquire uranium one.
 HANNITY: John, you go into extensive detail in a very long and hard-hitting piece tonight and revealing piece, how the FBI informant — you actually said six years, I thought he was only an informant for four years.
 He has evidence, was on the inside, directly from Putin’s Russia, the push for nuclear fuel deals, and all the crimes we talked about, bribery, kickback, extortion, money laundering, racketeering, all knelt corroborating and will be corroborated even further.
 Go into your report.
 JOHN SOLOMON, THE HILL: You know, Sara just said something about the importance of the dominance of the uranium market.
 This is an email that the FBI has had for six years.
 It shows that uranium one was part of a Russia strategy to control, not just benefit from the global market, controlled the global market.
 That would put the United States at a disadvantage.
 That is the sort of evidence that this FBI informant has right now.
 If you go back on the last week we heard several things from the Justice Department, there’s no connection to uranium one.
 These are emails that say uranium one that are in the FBI files.
 They said that there was no connection between the uranium one case and the criminal case.
 We now know the criminal case got its first evidence in 2009, a whole year before the uranium one deal was approved by the Obama administration.
 There are a lot of things that people have been saying that these documents simply don’t agree with.
 HANNITY: All right.
 I got a very high ranking Congressman and that knows, let us put it that way, and actually sent me a note.
 The knowledge of key administration officials will be the next thing proven by both of you, and the links to the Clinton foundation.
 Sara, is that true?
 CARTER: I believe that is true.
 I mean especially when we at —
 HANNITY: Do believe or you know?
 I can’t ask Victoria that question because she won’t tell me.
 CARTER: I know it’s true.
 I know that looking at these documents following the money, following the money is what’s important here.
 The Justice Department has not pointed out that they will possibly call a special counsel to this.
 This is still out there.
 They are looking into it.
 That is something that they need to decide.
 But whether it’s a special counsel or whether it’s a prosecutor that is investigating this, they will be able to follow the money.
 There are somethings said …
 HANNITY: When you say follow the money, my suspicion would go to the money came directly from Russia, was funneled through the Canadian donors to the Clinton Foundation.
 How good are my instincts?
 CARTER: You have pretty good instincts.
 I think there’s a lot of other areas that they will be looking at as well.
 Remember this is like peeling back an onion.
 You peel one part and then you find another part.
 And that is what’s going to require somebody to do an extensive investigation.
 HANNITY: But it is beginning to cascade Sara.
 CARTER: It is.
 HANNITY: John, I want her to respond to the same thing, that the Clinton Foundation, that this will be traced back to high-ranking Obama administration officials and the Clinton Foundation, and if you add the money portion Sara mentioned?
 SOLOMON: I do.
 I think the place we will be talking about in the next couple weeks as the Clinton global initiative.
 Sort of a side project of the Clinton Foundation.
 There are new flows of money there that we will report on then the next couple of weeks.
 There were also some personal business projects, some very senior Clinton people that got a remarkable infusion of cash from Russia.
 It will be able to talk about that in the next couple of weeks.
 Another layer of interest of the story.
 HANNITY: All right.
 We have a lot of time in the segment so I want to go very slowly here.
 Both of you, before I get to Victoria, Sara and John, you both in your pieces said 5,000 documents.
 I hear the number the FBI informant is much, much greater, tens of thousands.
 True or false?
 SOLOMON: That seems to be accurate.
 We have a subset of the documents and they are very voluminous.
 HANNITY: Now let me go to Victoria.
 One of the great attorneys.
 She is the most difficult to get any information out of.
 Victoria, one of the things I’ve known about you, and I’ve interviewed you so many times over the years, you now have been doing a deep dive into all of this.
 You are now representing this FBI informant.
 I think they will become an American hero out of all of this, but apparently, he was fighting and begging and pleading and saying the Russians are here, they are doing this, why are you paying attention?
 I hope my instincts are right there, and number two, how devastating it legally is this going to be based on what I was just asking Sara and John about impacting former Obama officials, money, Clinton foundation?
 VICTORIA TOENSING, ATTORNEY REPRESENTING FBI INFORMANT: Let me go to number one first, that is the whole essence of what John and Sara and I are talking about is that in 2009, 2010, our FBI and presumably our Justice Department, and the White House, as my client was told, all knew about this corruption in the Russian nuclear energy area.
 There’s no separate companies.
 They are all related.
 The Russian nuclear energy is controlled from the top, from Putin.
 They are all one.
 They all talk to each other.
 So the evidence about this corruption was known to our government in 2009, 2010, and why is it that CFIUS either wasn’t told, or CFIUS people knowing about it —
 HANNITY: Explain CFIUS, 13 agencies, I am sorry 9 agencies approving the deal that gave control of uranium one to the bad actor, hostile regime, Putin Russia.
 TOENSING: They said, the CFIUS board said that the bad Russians could buy uranium one, which contains access to 20 percent of the U.S.
 Uranium, why was that decision made?
 Was CFIUS told?
 Did Bob Mueller go to Eric Holder and tell him?
 Eric Holder sat on it.
 HANNITY: He was one of the nine.
 TOENSING: Did Bob Mueller go to the White House and tell him?
 The FBI agents told my client that they were briefing the President about his conduct.
 Of course, when the CFIUS decision was made.
 My client said, what happened?
 HANNITY: Back to my original question, counselor, if I may.
 You are too good at your job.
 This is a very serious point.
 Putting your legal hat on, objectively speaking, yes they knew, the evidence will prove it based on the documents and your client, crimes committed on a high level?
 National security compromise?
 TOENSING: Of course, it goes without saying giving the Russians control of the uranium was a national security compromise.
 I think that we are going to have to do is continue to follow the money because the reporting that John and Sara are going to be doing in a few days will be revealing about where lots of the various money went and where it came from.
 HANNITY: Always we go back, and I believe at the end of this you guys deserve a Pulitzer, and I’m not the only one thinking that.
 You have dug so deep on this, this has been a deep dive and I applaud you both.
 I want to ask as it relates to who knew what, and when.
 What did they know, when did they know it, John Solomon?
 I’m talking about Obama, Mueller, Eric Holder, and Hillary Clinton.
 SOLOMON: We are at a little disadvantage right now, because we don’t have those records, and also the records that Congress needs to go get, but I can tell you I have a person quoted in my story who has direct knowledge of what the Justice Department knew.
 This person said without a shred of doubt, we knew in 2009 a year before CFIUS ruled that Thomas were engaged in criminality, without a shadow of a doubt, we knew that Russia was trying to gain a corner on the U.S. market, get a strong hold on our uranium, and without a doubt we knew they were using political levers to try to get their way here.
 We are talking about control, like this document says, they are trying to gain control of our markets.
 That has to be national security interest that should have been raised in CFIUS.
 HANNITY: President daily briefings were told.
 Had this information in it before CFIUS approves this.
 CARTER: Sean.
 That is what we need to find out.
 We need to see those Presidential daily briefings.
 Congress can get those.
 They will be able to know whether or not President Obama was briefed on this and according to a number of people that I have spoken with as well, he was.
 I think that will reveal a whole other layer of who knew what, where and when.
 And we follow the money and it will reveal even more about Hillary Clinton and what she knew and when did she know it, and the other members of the CFIUS board.
 HANNITY: And Obama and Holder and Mueller?
 John, real quick, we are running out of time.
 SOLOMON: yes listen, I think even Sessions and Rosenstein have questions to answer.
 There are people in Congress who don’t think they’ve gotten a straight answer from them.
 HANNITY: All right.
 Victoria, we get the last word from you, laws broken?
 TOENSING: Well, of course.
 HANNITY: You are so good at your job.
 You are so annoyingly good.
 The American people deserve the truth varied our security was compromised, we import uranium, because we don’t have enough.
 Newt Gingrich will weigh in on this and more things and about the Clintons.
 Are they facing their day of reckoning?
 And a big announcement at the end of the show.

"ICE Deports Guatemalan Man Wanted For Assassination
 
 SPRINGFIELD, Mo.
 — A Guatemalan man, wanted by law enforcement authorities in his home country for killing a store owner, was removed Thursday by deportation officers.
 Jose Manuel Ohajacao-Ramos, was transferred Nov. 9 to the custody of Guatemalan law enforcement officials by ERO officers in Guatemala City, Guatemala.
 According to Guatemalan authorities, Ohajacao-Ramos is accused of fatally shooting a store owner in his store in June 1997.
 Guatemalan law lists the charge as an assassination.
 Ohajacao-Ramos legally entered the United States in 1998 as a visitor and overstayed his temporary visa by more than 18 years.
 He was arrested at his home in Neosho, Missouri, in May 2017.
 In September, a federal immigration judge ordered him removed to his home country.
 Ohajacao-Ramos remained in ICE custody since his May arrest.
 “Removing foreign fugitives trying to escape law enforcement in their home countries is an ICE top priority,” said Ricardo Wong, field office director for ERO Chicago.
 “The cooperation between the U.S. and our Guatemalan counterparts resulted in returning this man who is a threat to public safety.”
 Since Oct. 1, 2009, ERO has removed more than 1,700 foreign fugitives from the United States who were sought in their native countries for serious crimes, including kidnapping, rape and murder.
 In fiscal year 2016, ICE conducted 240,255 removals nationwide.
 Ninety-two percent of individuals removed from the interior of the United States had previously been convicted of a criminal offense.

"ICE Arrests 22 In Chicago Area During 3-Day Operation
 
 CHICAGO — Federal officers with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) arrested 22 criminal aliens and immigration violators in Illinois’ Cook and Lake counties during a three-day enforcement action, which ended Monday.
 During this operation, ERO deportation officers made arrests in the following Illinois cities and towns: Chicago (9), Cicero (4), Hoffman Estates (1), Palatine (4), Park City (1), Rolling Meadows (2) and Round Lake Beach (1).
 All those arrested were men between the ages of 20 and 53.
 Aliens arrested during this operation are from the following five countries: Ecuador (1), Honduras (2), Mexico (17), Serbia (1) and Ukraine (1).
 Six of the 22 arrested during this operation were criminal aliens who were released back into their communities after local law enforcement failed to honor an immigration detainer placed on the individuals by ICE.
 Immigration detainers request that ICE be notified before the individual is released from local custody for any reason.
 Most of the aliens targeted by ERO deportation officers during this operation had prior criminal histories that included convictions for the following crimes: sexual assault, kidnapping, assault, assault with a weapon, drug possession, theft, obstruction of justice and driving under the influence (DUI); two were known fugitive immigration violators, and six were arrested for illegally re-entering the United States after having been deported, which is a felony.
 The following are criminal summaries of the offenders arrested in Illinois during this operation:
 A 38-year-old Mexican citizen and a known gang member was arrested Jan. 8 in Rolling Meadows.
 He was previously convicted in Cook County for felony aggravated criminal sexual assault and bodily harm.
 He was previously deported.
 Cook County Sheriff’s Office did not honor the ICE detainer that was placed.
 He remains in ICE custody pending presentation of criminal prosecution for re-entry after deportation.
 A 37-year-old previously deported Mexican man was arrested Jan. 7 in Chicago.
 He was previously convicted twice of drug possession, and he has pending criminal charges for sexually assaulting a child.
 He remains in ICE custody pending presentation of criminal prosecution for re-entry after deportation.
 A 20-year-old Mexican man and a known gang member was arrested Jan. 7 in Round Lake Beach.
 He was previously convicted of battery.
 He is also Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipient with two extensions.
 He was served a notice to appear before a federal immigration judge, and will remain in ICE custody pending disposition of his immigration proceedings.
 A 32-year-old previously deported Ecuadoran man was arrested Jan. 7 in Chicago.
 He has criminal convictions for DUI, domestic assault and assault.
 He remains in ICE custody pending presentation of criminal prosecution for re-entry after deportation.
 A 46-year-old previously deported Mexican man was arrested Jan. 7 in Chicago.
 He has a criminal conviction for possessing cocaine.
 He remains in ICE custody pending presentation of criminal prosecution for re-entry after deportation.
 Depending on an alien’s criminality, an alien who re-enters the United States after having been previously deported commits a felony punishable by up to 20 years in federal prison, if convicted.
 “Our dedicated officers strive to make our communities safer by arresting convicted criminal aliens and removing them from the United States despite the reckless sanctuary policies that are currently in place in Cook County that put our communities at risk,” said Ricardo Wong, field office director of ERO Chicago.
 “This operation focused on targeting immigration fugitives and criminal aliens in two Illinois counties, but we routinely conduct operations daily.
 By removing criminal aliens from the streets, our ICE officers provide an invaluable community service by improving public safety.”
 All of the targets in this operation were amenable to arrest and removal under the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act.
 ICE deportation officers carry out targeted enforcement operations daily nationwide as part of the agency’s ongoing efforts to protect the nation, uphold public safety, and protect the integrity of our immigration laws and border controls.

"DOJ Unseals Indictment Involving Uranium One Scandal
 
 This report was originally published by Tyler Durden at Zero Hedge
 The Department of Justice unsealed an 11-count indictment on Friday to a former DoD intelligence analyst-turned uranium transportation executive who stands accused of a bribery and money laundering scheme involving a Russian nuclear official connected to the Uranium One deal.
 The indictment corroborates a November report by The Hill that an FBI mole deeply embedded in the Russian uranium industry had gathered extensive evidence of the scheme.
 Mark Lambert, 54, of Mount Airy, Maryland, was charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and to commit wire fraud, seven counts of violating the FCPA, two counts of wire fraud and one count of international promotion money laundering.
 The charges stem from an alleged scheme to bribe Vadim Mikerin, a Russian official at JSC Techsnabexport (TENEX), a subsidiary of Russia’s State Atomic Energy Corporation and the sole supplier and exporter of Russian Federation uranium and uranium enrichment services to nuclear power companies worldwide, in order to secure contracts with TENEX.
 According to the indictment, beginning at least as early as 2009 and continuing until October 2014, Lambert conspired with others at “Transportation Corporation A” to make corrupt and fraudulent bribery and kickback payments to offshore bank accounts associated with shell companies, at the direction of, and for the benefit of, a Russian official, Vadim Mikerin, in order to secure improper business advantages and obtain and retain business with TENEX.
 –DOJ
 While the indictment lists Lambert’s company as “Transportation Corporation A,” a simple search reveals that Lambert is the co-President of DAHER-TLI, “the leading front end freight forwarding company dedicated to Nuclear Cargo,” according to its website.
 In 2012, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission sent a letter to Lambert with findings that TLI had exported plutonium “in excess of the maximum quantity and type applied for and licensed,” and “exported Australian obligated material, which was not authorized under license conditions.”
 Prior to his 26 year tenure in the transportation industry – 20 of which have been with TLI, Mr. Lambert was an Arabic Linguist for the Navy for five years, and a Senior Intel Analyst for the Department of Defense (DoD) for three years.
 Lambert also speaks fluent Arabic and Farsi (Persian), along with French and Italian.
 The indictment against Lambert corroborates prior reporting by The Hill that an FBI mole buried deep within the Russian nuclear industry had gathered extensive evidence of a scheme involving bribes and kickbacks between Russian nuclear officials and TLI – which would have transported the U.S. uranium sold to Russia in the ’20 percent’ Uranium One deal.
 “The Russians were compromising American contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats, all of which raised legitimate national security concerns.
 And none of that evidence got aired before the Obama administration made those decisions,” a person who worked on the case told The Hill, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by U.S. or Russian officials.”
 Based on what the FBI knew – including evidence which purportedly includes a video of Russians preparing briefcases of bribe money – the Uranium One deal never should have gone through.
 Moreover, both Robert Mueller and current deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein were directly involved – and current Attorney General Jeff Sessions and other Justice Department officials appear to be covering for them.
 In short, the FBI had ample evidence of the Russian bribery plot before the Obama administration approved the Uranium One deal thanks to their embedded mole in the Russian nuclear industry.
 The informant – outed as energy consultant William Campbell – was “threatened” by Obama admin AG Loretta Lynch to keep quiet with an iron-clad gag order, according to his attorney – former Reagan Justice Dept.
 official and former Chief Counsel to the Senate Intelligence Committee Victoria Toensing.
 After Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-VA) demanded Campbell be allowed to testify in front of Congress, the gag order was lifted.
 Attorney General Jeff Sessions originally tried to claim that there was no connection between Uranium One and the nuclear transport bribery case, however several congressional republicans pushed back:
 “Attorney General Sessions seemed to say that the bribery, racketeering and money laundering offenses involving Tenex’s Vadim Mikerin occurred after the approval of the Uranium One deal by the Obama administration.
 But we know that the FBI’s confidential informant was actively compiling incriminating evidence as far back as 2009,” Rep. Ron DeSantis, (R-Fla.) told The Hill.
 “It is hard to fathom how such a transaction could have been approved without the existence of the underlying corruption being disclosed.
 I hope AG Sessions gets briefed about the CI and gives the Uranium One case the scrutiny it deserves,” added DeSantis, whose House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittees is one of the investigating panels.
 Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) sent a similar rebuke last week to Rosenstein, saying the deputy attorney general’s first response to the committee “largely missed the point” of the congressional investigations.
 “The essential question is whether the Obama Justice Department provided notice of the criminal activity of certain officials before the CFIUS approval of the Uranium One deal and other government decisions that enabled the Russians to trade nuclear materials in the U.S,” Grassley scolded.”
 Meanwhile, journalists John Solomon and journalist Sara Carter claim to have copies of the FBI informant’s evidence, while Carter issued an explosive report in late November laying out the players, the timeline, and the evidence at hand.
 “By the time the sale of Uranium One was approved by the Obama Administration, the FBI’s investigators had already gathered substantial evidence and the bureau was also aware of Russia’s intentions to enter the U.S. energy market and its desire to purchase a stake in American uranium,” Carter writes.
 Highlights:
 FBI mole William Campbell was a highly valued FBI asset – paid $51,000 by FBI officials at a celebration dinner in Chrystal City, VA, where Campbell’s attorney says they thanked him for his service.
 Campbell was required by the Russians, under threat, to launder large sums of money – which allowed the FBI to uncover a massive Russian “nuclear money laundering apparatus”
 Campbell collected over 5,000 documents and briefs over a six year period
 Campbell uncovered a Russian plot to penetrate the Obama administration and gain approval for the Uranium One sale, including a 2010 email which describes “Russia’s intent on expanding its Uranium expansion in the United States.”
 “This is not just about bribery and kickbacks but about a U.S. company that was transporting yellow-cake for the Russians with our approval,” an unnamed U.S. Intelligence official told Carter, adding “This should raise serious questions.
 At the time everyone was concerned about Russia’s ties to Iran, we still are.
 And of course, Russia’s intentions and reach into the U.S. energy market.”
 Given Friday’s unsealed indictment, however it looks like the DOJ may have changed their tune on Campbell.
 If so, perhaps that “briefcase full of bribe money” video will finally see the light of day.

"We Should Be More Like Sweden: Gov May Use Army Against Immigrant Gangs
 
 Progressives say we should be more like Sweden.
 That means turning our country into a hopeless hellhole where the native population is overtaxed and terrorized by warring foreign gangs.
 We're getting there too.
 What should we do?
 Maybe we should be more like Sweden?
 Sweden will do whatever it takes, including sending in the army, to end a wave of gang violence that has seen a string of deadly shootings, Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said in Wednesday.
 Sweden's murder rate is relatively low in international terms, but gang violence has surged in recent years and Swedes are worried that the police are unable to cope.
 Of course they can't cope.
 It's Demolition Man in real life pitting refugee war criminals and terrorists against bureaucrats with badges who are used to telling people not to raise their voices.
 Four people were shot dead in the first week of this year.
 One man died after picking up a hand grenade outside a subway station in a suburb of Stockholm.
 Law and order is likely to be a major issue in a parliamentary election scheduled for September with the populist, opposition Sweden Democrats linking public concern about the rising crime rate to a large increase in the numbers of immigrants.
 ""It would not be my first option to bring in the military, but I am prepared to do whatever is necessary to make sure that serious, organized crime is stamped out,"" Lofven told news agency TT.
 Bringing in the military comes in as an option ahead of cutting migration to Sweden.
 That tells you everything.
 Why would anyone associate rising crime and immigration?
 Maybe because the gangs in question are immigrant gangs.
 The government has promised police an extra 7.1 billion crowns ($880 million) through 2020, toughened laws on gun crimes and made it easier for the police to monitor private phone calls and emails, among other measures.
 Sound familiar?
 Mass repression and police powers that don't actually address the cause of the problem.
 Meanwhile the Grenade Amnesty doesn't seem to have worked.
 And the gang violence keeps rising.
 But who are these gangs?
 The criminal gang Loyal to Familia has already spread across Denmark from its base in the Nørrebro district of Copenhagen and now it appears to have set its sights on Sweden.
 Swedish police told the Danish tabloid Ekstra Bladet that the gang is trying to build a presence in both Malmö and Helsingborg.
 An expansion into Malmö could be a recipe for increased violence in light of the fact that gun violence claimed the lives of 11 people in the southern Swedish city last year.
 The gang's leader, Shuaib Khan, confirmed that the group is eyeing the two Swedish cities but denied that Loyal to Familia was a “criminal gang”.
 Just one of those Danish gangs led by a fellow named Khan.

 The war for dominance in the Middle East, following the crushing of ISIS, appears about to commence in Syria—with NATO allies America and Turkey on opposing sides.
 Turkey is moving armor and troops south to Syria's border enclave of Afrin, occupied by Kurds, to drive them out, and then drive the Syrian Kurds out of Manbij further south as well.
 Says President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, "" We will destroy all terror nests, one by one, in Syria, starting from Afrin and Manbij.""
 For Erdogan, the Kurdish YPG, the major U.S. ally in Syria, is an arm of the Kurdish PKK in Turkey, which we and the Turks have designated as a terrorist organization.
 While the Kurds were our most effective allies against ISIS in Syria, Turkey views them as a mortal peril and intends to deal with that threat.
 If Erdogan is serious, a clash with the U.S. is coming, as our Kurdish allies occupy most of Syria's border with Turkey.
 Moreover, the U.S. has announced plans to create a 30,000-man Border Security Force of Kurds and Arabs to keep ISIS out of Syria.
 Erdogan has branded this BSF a ""terror army,"" and President Bashar Assad of Syria has called BSF members ""traitors.""
 This U.S. plan to create a BSF inside Syria, Damascus declared , ""represents a blatant attack on the sovereignty and territorial integrity and unity of Syria, and a flagrant violation of international law.""
 Does not the Syrian government have a point?
 Now that ISIS has been driven out of Raqqa and Syria, by what authority do U.S. forces remain to arm troops to keep the Damascus government from reimposing its authority on its own territory?
 Secretary of State Tillerson gave Syria the news Wednesday.
 The U.S. troop commitment to Syria, he said, is now open-ended.
 Our goals: Guarantee al-Qaida and ISIS do not return and set up sanctuary; cope with rising Iranian influence in Damascus; and pursue the removal of Bashar Assad's ruthless regime.
 But who authorized this strategic commitment, of indefinite duration, in Syria, when near two decades in Afghanistan have failed to secure that nation against the return of al-Qaida and ISIS?
 Again and again, the American people have said they do not want to be dragged into Syria's civil war.
 Donald Trump won the presidency on a promise of no more unnecessary wars.
 Have the American people been had again?
 Will they support a clash with NATO ally Turkey, to keep armed Kurds on Turkey's border, when the Turks regard them as terrorists?
 Are we prepared for a shooting war with a Syrian army, backed by Russia, Iran, Hezbollah and Shiite militias from Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, to hold onto a fourth of Syria's territory in alliance with Kurds?
 The U.S. coalition in Syria said this week the BSF will be built up ""over the next several years"" and ""be stationed along the borders ... to include portions of the Euphrates river valley and international borders to the east and north.""
 Remarkable: A U.S.-created border army is going to occupy and control long stretches of Syria's borders with Turkey and Iraq, over Syria's objections.
 And the U.S. military will stand behind the BSF.
 Are the 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria really up to that task, should the Turks decide to cleanse the Syrian border of Kurds, or should the Syrian regime decide to take back territory occupied by the Kurds?
 Who sanctioned this commitment to a new army, which, if Syria and its Russian and Iranian allies, and the Turks, do not all back down, risks a major U.S. war with no allies but the Kurds?
 As for Syria's Kurds casting their lot with the Americans, one wonders: Did they not observe what happened when their Iraqi cousins, after helping us drive ISIS out of Mosul, were themselves driven out of Kirkuk by the Iraqi army, as their U.S. allies watched?
 In the six-year Syrian civil war, which may be about to enter a new phase, America faces a familiar situation.
 While our ""allies"" and adversaries have vital interests there, we do not.
 The Assads have been in power for the lifetime of most Americans.
 And we Americans have never shown a desire to fight there.
 Assad has a vital interest: preservation of his family regime and the reunification of his country.
 The Turks have a vital interest in keeping armed Kurds out of their border regions adjacent to their own Kurdish minority, which seeks greater independence.
 The Israelis and Saudi royals want the U.S. to keep Iran from securing a land bridge from Tehran to Damascus to Lebanon.
 The U.S. War Party wants us to smash Iran and remain in the Middle East forever to assure the hegemony of its favorites.
 Have the generals taking us into Syria told the president how and when, if ever, they plan to get us out?

"Uranium One Informant Breaks Silence: Moscow Paid Millions To Influence Hillary Clinton
 
 The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.
 -Article 2, Section 4 of the US Constitution
 Right off the bat, this appears to be clear bribery, and a case could be made for treason.
 However, it is now being reported that an FBI informant that was involved in the Uranium One deal, has told congressional committees that Moscow paid lobbyists to influence then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by helping former President Bill Clinton’s charities during the Obama administration.
 The Hill's John Solomon reported on Wednesday:
 The informant, Douglas Campbell, said in the statement obtained by The Hill that he was told by Russian nuclear executives that Moscow had hired the American lobbying firm APCO Worldwide specifically because it was in position to influence the Obama administration, and more specifically Hillary Clinton.
 ... Campbell added in the testimony that Russian nuclear officials “told me at various times that they expected APCO to apply a portion of the $3 million annual lobbying fee it was receiving from the Russians to provide in-kind support for the Clintons' Global Initiative.""
 “The contract called for four payments of $750,000 over twelve months.
 APCO was expected to give assistance free of charge to the Clinton Global Initiative as part of their effort to create a favorable environment to ensure the Obama administration made affirmative decisions on everything from Uranium One to the U.S.-Russia Civilian Nuclear Cooperation agreement.""
 APCO officials told The Hill that its support for the Clinton Global Initiative and its work with Russia were not connected in any way, and in fact involved different divisions of the firm.
 They added their lobbying for Russia did not involve Uranium One but rather focused on regulatory issues aimed at helping Russia better compete for nuclear fuel contracts inside the United States.
 In case you are unfamiliar with Uranium One, it is a Canadian mining company whose sale to a Russian firm was approved in 2010.
 The sale gave the Russians control of part of the US uranium supply, thus why I reference a case could be made for treason.
 While Democrats have unsurprisingly questioned Campbell's credibility, Campbell's attorney Victoria Toensing told Sean Hannity, “[The Russians] were so confident that they told Mr. Campbell with the Clinton’s help, it was a shoo-in to get CFIUS [The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States] approval.
 They were so confident in that that they even had him open up the new office because they were planning on the kind of business they were going to do as soon as CFIUS approved it.”
 In a lengthy report by Award-winning National Security/War Correspondent Sara Carter, she pointed out that following:
 On Wednesday, he shared with the committee information he provided to the FBI and has in the past described his frustration with the Obama administration’s failure to stop Russia’s nuclear giant from purchasing 20 percent of American uranium mining assets.
 Campbell testified before numerous Congressional investigators that his extensive counterintelligence work on Russia and stated that during his time as an informant, he obtained information that Russia was continuing to aid the Iranian government.
 According to Campbell Russia provided the resources necessary for the nation’s nuclear reactors, despite promises that they were not sharing such technology with Iran.
 In an April 16, 2010, summary brief provided to his former FBI handlers and obtained by this reporter, he stressed his deep concerns about Tenex, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Russian state nuclear arm Rosatom and its ongoing work to provide Iran with the technology needed for its nuclear reactor program.
 At the time, Rosatom was seeking the approval to purchase the Canadian mining company Uranium One.
 “TENEX continues to supply Iran with fuel through their Russian company TVEL,” stated Campbell in a 2010 brief provided to the FBI.
 TVEL is a Russian nuclear fuel cycle company headquartered in Moscow.
 “They (TVEL) continue to assist with construction consult and fabricated assemblies to supply the reactor.
 Fabricated assemblies require sophisticated engineering and are arranged inside the reactor with the help and consult of TVEL.” Campbell informed the FBI of the close relationship between TVEL and TENEX, both a part of the Rosatom group.
 He stated in his brief that while spending time with the Russian executives from both Rosatom and Tenex, that any mention of “TVEL is a subject that is serious to all when mentioned.
 I do not even raise the subject of TVEL to our friends, but occasionally they speak of it and always in a guarded manner.” In the briefs, he informed the FBI that “occasionally someone will mention having been in Iran but usually it is long after the fact.” And when he asked the Russians about these connections, he stated that they “occasionally speak of the relationship, i.e.
 equipment, consulting.
 I asked Vadim (Mikerin) if they felt there was a serious problem, and would they adhere to sanctions and western opinion.
 His response was a smile and shoulder shrug.” But Campbell had provided the FBI with evidence of the criminal network and delivered the information to the FBI, which was monitoring his work as an informant and approving his transfer of bribery money to the Russians.
 Those transfers, which were made in bulk $50,000 sums and at times delivered in cash, occurred between senior executives of the American transportation company and the Russian executives connected to Rosatom.
 He had given the FBI irrefutable evidence showing how contracts obtained from the same Russian energy company Tenex, were based on contract bribery and other nefarious actions, he said.
 Senior members of the FBI, Department of Treasury, Department of Energy and Department of Justice were also briefed on Campbell’s information and were apprised of the various facets pertaining to Russia’s acquisition of the Canadian company.
 In fact, Campbell had been told by his FBI handlers that his work had made it at least twice into President Obama’s classified presidential daily briefings.
 Of course, we know what Obama did with his daily briefings.
 They are somewhere in the White House sewer system.
 Campbell's work has resulted in real justice being administered.
 In January, I reported:
 On Friday, the Justice Department unsealed an 11-count indictment concerning the Uranium One scandal.
 Sadly, it did not include former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, but rather former DoD intelligence analyst-turned uranium transportation executive Mark Lambert of Mount Airy, Maryland.
 Lambert, 54, was charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and to commit wire fraud, seven counts of violating the FCPA, two counts of wire fraud and one count of international promotion money laundering.
 The charges stem from an alleged scheme to bribe Vadim Mikerin, a Russian official at JSC Techsnabexport (TENEX), a subsidiary of Russia’s State Atomic Energy Corporation and the sole supplier and exporter of Russian Federation uranium and uranium enrichment services to nuclear power companies worldwide, in order to secure contracts with TENEX.
 According to the DOJ: According to the indictment, beginning at least as early as 2009 and continuing until October 2014, Lambert conspired with others at “Transportation Corporation A” to make corrupt and fraudulent bribery and kickback payments to offshore bank accounts associated with shell companies, at the direction of, and for the benefit of, a Russian official, Vadim Mikerin, in order to secure improper business advantages and obtain and retain business with TENEX.
 In order to effectuate and conceal the corrupt and fraudulent bribe payments, Lambert and others allegedly caused fake invoices to be prepared, purportedly from TENEX to Transportation Corporation A, that described services that were never provided, and then Lambert and others caused Transportation Corporation A to wire the corrupt payments for those purported services to shell companies in Latvia, Cyprus and Switzerland.
 Lambert and others also allegedly used code words like “lucky figures,” “LF,” “lucky numbers,” and “cake” to describe the payments in emails to the Russian official at his personal email account.
 The indictment also alleges that Lambert and others caused Transportation Corporation A to overbill TENEX by building the cost of the corrupt payments into their invoices, and TENEX thus overpaid for Transportation Corporation A’s services.
 In June 2015, Lambert’s former co-president, Daren Condrey, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the FCPA and commit wire fraud, and Vadim Mikerin pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering involving violations of the FCPA.
 Mikerin is currently serving a sentence of 48 months in prison and Condrey is awaiting sentencing.
 The indictment includes allegations against Lambert based on his role in effectuating the criminal scheme with Condrey, Mikerin, and others.
 We also know the following about Campbell:
 Undercover FBI informant William Campbell has given written testimony to Congressional investigators after an ""iron clad"" gag order was lifted in October
 Campbell was a highly valued CIA and FBI asset deeply embedded in the Russian nuclear industry while Robert Mueller was the Director of the FBI
 while Robert Mueller was the Director of the FBI Campbell was required by the Russians, under threat, to launder large sums of money - which allowed the FBI to uncover a massive Russian ""nuclear money laundering apparatus ""
 "" He collected over 5,000 documents and briefs over a six year period, some of which detail efforts by Moscow to route money to the Clinton Foundation
 Campbell claims to have video evidence of bribe money related to the Uranium One deal being stuffed into suitcases.
 of bribe money related to the Uranium One deal being stuffed into suitcases.
 The Obama FBI knew about the bribery scheme, yet the administration still approved the Uranium One deal.
 To thank him for his service, Campbell was paid $51,000 by FBI officials at a 2016 celebration dinner in Chrystal City
 When it emerged that Campbell had evidence against the Clinton Foundation, a Yahoo News article by Michael Isikoff (of FISA warrant application fame) slammed Campbell as a ""disaster"" potential witness
 All of this then goes back to things we have pointed out with ranchers in the western united States and how this impacts them, as well as the land grabs that are unconstitutionally orchestrated by the DC government and the Bureau of Land Management.
 There is also substantial documentation that was discovered in Oregon that relates to this deal during the Oregon occupation in 2016, which got zero coverage in the mainstream media.
 Are we about to see a serious shakedown in all of this?
 Time will tell, but I remain skeptical, as in the end, all we ever get is excuses rather than justice.

 Candidate Donald Trump may have promised to extricate us from Middle East wars, once ISIS and al-Qaida were routed, yet events and people seem to be conspiring to keep us endlessly enmeshed.
 Friday night, a drone, apparently modeled on a U.S. drone that fell into Iran's hands, intruded briefly into Israeli airspace over the Golan Heights, and was shot down by an Apache helicopter.
 Israel seized upon this to send F-16s to strike the airfield whence the drone originated.
 Returning home, an F-16 was hit and crashed, unleashing the most devastating Israeli attack in decades on Syria.
 Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu says a dozen Syrian and Iranian bases and antiaircraft positions were struck.
 Monday's headline on The Wall Street Journal op-ed page blared:
 ""The Pentagon and State Department have already condemned Iran and thrown their support behind Israel.
 The question now is whether the Trump administration will go further.
 ... Secretary of State Rex Tillerson (has) affirmed that the U.S. seeks not only to ensure its allies' security but to deny Iran its 'dreams of a northern arch' from Tehran to Beirut.
 A good way to achieve both objectives would be back Israel's response to Iran's aggression--now and in the future.""
 Op-ed writers Tony Badran and Jonathan Schanzer, both from the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, The FDD is an annex of the Israeli lobby and a charter member of the War Party.
 Chagai Tzuriel , who heads the Israeli Ministry of Intelligence, echoed the FDD: ""If you (Americans) are committed to countering Iran in the region, then you must do so in Syria--first.""
 Our orders have been cut.
 Iran has dismissed as ""lies"" and ""ridiculous"" the charge that it sent the drone into Israeli airspace.
 If Tehran did, it would be an act of monumental stupidity.
 Not only did the drone bring devastating Israeli reprisals against Syria and embarrass Iran's ally Russia, it brought attacks on Russian-provided and possibly Russian-manned air defenses.
 Moreover, in recent months Iranian policy--suspending patrol boat harassment of U.S. warships--appears crafted to ease tensions and provide no new causes for Trump to abandon the nuclear deal Prime Minister Hassan Rouhani regards as his legacy.
 Indeed, why would Iran, which, with Assad, Russia and Hezbollah, is among the victors in Syria's six-year civil war, wish to reignite the bloodletting and bring Israeli and U.S. firepower in on the other side?
 In Syria's southeast, another incident a week ago may portend an indefinite U.S. stay in that broken and bleeding country.
 To recapture oil fields lost in the war, forces backed by Assad crossed the Euphrates into territory taken from ISIS by the U.S. and our Kurd allies.
 The U.S. response was a barrage of air and artillery strikes that killed 100 soldiers.
 What this signals is that, though ISIS has been all but evicted from Syria, the U.S. intends to retain that fourth of Syria as a bargaining chip in negotiations.
 In the northwest, Turkey has sent its Syrian allies to attack Afrin and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has threatened Manbij, 80 miles to the east, where U.S. troops commingle with the Kurd defenders and U.S. generals were visible last week.
 Midweek, Erdogan exploded: ""(The Americans) tell us, 'Don't come to Manbij.'
 We will come to Manbij to hand over these territories to their rightful owners.""
 The U.S. and Turkey, allies for six decades, with the largest armies in NATO, may soon be staring down each other's gun barrels.
 Has President Trump thought through where we are going with this deepening commitment in Syria, where we have only 2,000 troops and no allies but the Kurds, while on the other side is the Syrian army, Hezbollah, Russia and Iran, and Shiite militias from Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan?
 Clearly, we have an obligation not to abandon the Kurds, who took most of the casualties in liberating eastern Syria from ISIS.
 And we have a strategic interest in not losing Turkey as an ally.
 But this calls for active diplomacy, not military action.
 And now that the rebels have been defeated and the civil war is almost over, what would be the cost and what would be the prospects of fighting a new and wider war?
 What would victory look like?
 Bibi and the FDD want to see U.S. power deployed alongside that of Israel, against Iran, Assad and Hezbollah.
 But while Israel's interests are clear, what would be the U.S. vital interest?
 What outcome would justify another U.S. war in a region where all the previous wars in this century have left us bleeding, bankrupt, divided and disillusioned?
 When he was running , Donald Trump seemed to understand this.

"ICE arrests 145 in South and Central Texas during 7-day operation targeting criminal aliens
 
 SAN ANTONIO — Deportation officers with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) arrested 145 criminal aliens and immigration violators in South and Central Texas during a seven-day enforcement action, which ended Feb. 16.
 During this operation, ERO deportation officers made arrests in the following Texas cities and towns: Austin (45), San Antonio (41), Rio Grande Valley (37), Laredo (15) and Waco (7).
 Of the 145 arrested, 86 had criminal convictions; 39 were arrested based on previous immigration encounters, four of which have pending criminal charges; 20 had no prior immigration history or encounters, one has pending criminal charges.
 Of the total arrests 135 were men and 10 were women.
 They range in age from 18 to 62 years old.
 Aliens arrested during this operation are from the following countries: Mexico (128), Guatemala (7), El Salvador (1), Honduras (7), Peru (1) and Jordan (1).
 Most of the aliens targeted by ERO deportation officers during this operation had prior criminal histories that included convictions for the following crimes: indecency with a child, assault, deadly conduct, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, drug possession, drug trafficking, burglary, resisting arrest, firearms offense, alien smuggling, illegally entering the U.S., and driving under the influence (DUI).
 Sixty one of those arrested illegally re-entered the United States after having been previously deported, which is a felony.
 Depending on an alien’s criminality, an alien who re-enters the United States after having been previously deported commits a felony punishable by up to 20 years in federal prison, if convicted.
 Following are criminal summaries of three offenders arrested during this operation:
 Feb. 14 – A previously deported 42-year-old illegal alien from Mexico was arrested in Harlingen, Texas.
 He was convicted in 2011 of indecency with a child, a felony, and was sentenced to 10 years’ probation.
 He is currently facing federal criminal charges for illegally re-entering the United States after having been deported.
 He remains in U.S.
 Marshals custody pending the outcome of his criminal case.
 Feb. 15 – A 42- year-old illegal alien from Mexico was arrested in San Antonio.
 He was convicted in 2008 for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and sentenced to four months in federal prison.
 In October 2017, he was convicted for DUI and sentenced to 15 months in prison.
 He is currently in ICE custody pending removal.
 Feb. 13 – A previously deported 40-year-old illegal alien from Mexico was arrested in San Antonio.
 He was previously removed to Mexico in 2009 after he illegally entered the United States through Laredo, Texas.
 Sometime after 2009, he illegally re-entered the United States and was arrested at his residence where officers discovered six handguns in his possession.
 He is being prosecuted for re-entry after deportation, and illegal alien possessing a firearm.
 He remains in U.S.
 Marshals custody pending the outcome of his criminal case.
 “The results of this operation are a clear indication of ICE’s commitment regarding the role we play in keeping our communities safe by locating, arresting and ultimately removing at-large criminal aliens who pose a threat to public safety, and other immigration fugitives,” said Daniel Bible, field office director for ERO in San Antonio.
 “ICE’s leadership has made clear that ICE will no longer exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement.
 All of those in violation of the immigration laws may be subject to immigration arrest, detention and – if found removable by final order – removal from the United States.
 By effecting these immigration enforcement operations, the dedicated men and women of ICE help keep our communities safe.”
 All of the targets in this operation were amenable to arrest and removal under the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act.
 ICE deportation officers carry out targeted enforcement operations daily nationwide as part of the agency’s ongoing efforts to protect the nation, uphold public safety, and protect the integrity of our immigration laws and border controls.
 During targeted enforcement operations, ICE officers frequently encounter other aliens illegally present in the United States.
 These aliens are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and, when appropriate, they are arrested by ICE officers.

"DOJ May Hit #Resistance Mayor Who Warned Illegal Criminals w/Obstruction of Justice
 
 ICE had already called out Oakland's radical leftist boss for helping criminals and endangering ICE personnel by tipping them off that a raid was coming.
 Her actions were quite clearly illegal, though she claimed that she had cleared her actions with lawyers beforehand, And now, a member of the #Resistance may actually end up fighting obstruction of justice charges.
 Thomas Homan, the acting director of ICE, slammed Mayor Schaaf, who on Saturday night released an unprecedented warning that ICE was about to begin arresting people.
 Schaaf said she issued the alert after receiving confidential tips from “credible sources,” and conferring with attorneys to make sure she wasn’t opening herself up to federal prosecution.
 The mayor’s move endangered ICE officers and alerted their targets, Homan asserted, “making clear that this reckless decision was based on her political agenda.” He said 864 “criminal aliens and public safety threats remain at large in the community, and I have to believe that some of them were able to elude us thanks to the mayor’s irresponsible decision.” Fox News, which was given a ride-along with ICE officers during the operation, reported that agency officials were asking the Department of Justice to investigate whether Schaaf broke any laws.
 Now the DOJ is looking into Schaaf.
 The Department of Justice is looking into whether Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf obstructed justice by warning Northern California residents of an impending raid by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
 The agency’s acting director, Thomas Homan, told “Fox & Friends” Wednesday morning that the DOJ is “reviewing” whether Schaaf broke any laws by telling her constituents ICE would be raiding the area in order to arrest people violating federal immigration laws.
 Schaaf, a Democrat, posted the warning to Twitter Saturday, writing that “multiple credible sources” told her the immigration agency was “preparing to conduct an operation in the Bay Area, including Oakland, starting as soon as” Sunday.
 “What she did is no better than a gang lookout yelling ‘police’ when a police cruiser comes in the neighborhood, except she did it to a whole community,” Homan told ""Fox & Friends.""
 ""There's over 800 significant public safety threat criminals ... that we are unable to locate because of that warning, so that community's a lot less safe than it would've been.""
 That's exactly it.
 And Dems have become honorary members of MS-13.
 And those who collaborate with illegal alien gang members should face the consequences.

"ICE Arrests Over 150 in Bay Area
 
 Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested more than 150 illegals in the San Francisco Bay Area this week -- no thanks to the Democrat mayor of Oakland, who tried to warn the constituents of her sanctuary city of impending ICE raids.
 Fox News reports that “targeted immigration enforcement operations” resulted in the arrests, about half of which snared fugitives with convictions for assault and battery, crimes against children, weapons charges and DUI.
 One such fugitive is a documented gang member whose “accumulated criminal convictions in California... have resulted in more than 15 years of prison sentencings” and who had previously been removed by ICE four times.
 Many of the other arrested illegals had criminal convictions from Mexico and Guatemala throughout Northern California.
 The arrests came despite a press release tweeted by Libby Schaaf, the Democratic mayor of Oakland, which noted that “multiple credible sources” told her ICE would be conducting the raids in the Bay Area.
 This did not win her any friends among law enforcement.
 ICE Deputy Director Thomas Homan said in a statement Tuesday,
 The Oakland mayor’s decision to publicize her suspicions about ICE operations further increased that risk for my officers and alerted criminal aliens — making clear that this reckless decision was based on her political agenda.
 Unlike the politicians who attempt to undermine ICE’s critical mission, our officers will continue to fulfill their sworn duty to protect public safety.
 True to the left's support for criminality over law and order, Mayor Schaaf declared that she considered it her ""duty"" to warn criminal illegals in her area.
 Fox News notes that ICE officials are asking the Department of Justice to look into whether she broke any laws by doing so.
 ICE reports that 864 illegal immigrants with criminal convictions and other public safety threats ""remain at large"" in the area -- an indeterminate number of whom may have been tipped off by a Democrat mayor who betrayed the law-abiding citizens of Northern California.

"How Many Child Rapists Did a Sanctuary City Mayor Tip Off?
 
 The price of a sanctuary city for illegal aliens is paid in abused children.
 Just ask the abused children of Oakland.
 A sweep of Northern California by federal immigration officials this week, which was partly thwarted when the Oakland mayor sounded the alarm, nabbed a number of illegal immigrants convicted of a variety of serious and violent crimes.
 Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials announced this week that the four-day raid led to the arrest of 232 illegal immigrants in the San Francisco Bay Area.
 Of those 232, 180 “were either convicted criminals, had been issued a final order of removal and failed to depart the United States, or had been previously removed” from the country and had come back illegally.
 The arrests included 115 who ""had prior felony convictions for serious or violent offenses, such as child sex crimes, weapons charges and assault, or had past convictions for significant or multiple misdemeanors.""
 The numbers might have been greater, but for the intervention of Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, who tweeted out a warning of the impending raid, tipping off others who might have been caught...
 ""I did what I believe was right for my community as well as to protect public safety,"" Schaaf said Friday, according to NBC Bay Area.
 ""People should be able to live without fear or panic and know their rights and responsibilities as well as their recourses.""

"ICE arrests 20 in Kansas City during 4-day operation targeting criminal aliens
 
 KANSAS CITY, Mo.
 — Federal officers with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) arrested 20 criminal aliens and immigration violators in the Kansas City metro area during a four-day enforcement operation, which ended Thursday.
 During this operation, ERO deportation officers made arrests in the following Missouri cities: St. Joseph (6), Belton (1), Blue Springs (1), Independence (2) and Kansas City (6).
 ICE officers also made arrests in the Kansas cities of Olathe (3) and Lawrence (1).
 Fifteen men and five women, ages ranging 18-61, were arrested.
 Aliens arrested during this operation are from the following countries: Brazil (1), El Salvador (3), Guatemala (6), Honduras (1), Mexico (7), Romania (1) and Sierra Leone (1).
 Several of the aliens targeted by ERO deportation officers during this operation had prior criminal histories that included driving under the influence, child neglect, child abuse, drug offenses, fraud and larceny.
 Four of these were arrested for illegally re-entering the United States after having been deported, which is a felony.
 Two overstayed lawful visits to the U.S.
 All were amenable to arrest and removal under the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act.
 The following are criminal summaries of some of the offenders arrested in the Kansas City area during this operation:
 A 55-year-old, Mexican citizen who overstayed a lawful visit to the U.S. by more than 12 years.
 She was arrested Feb. 26, 2018 in Johnson County Kansas.
 She was previously convicted of child neglect and was sentenced to a year in jail.
 She is currently in ICE custody pending removal proceedings.
 On Feb. 28, 2018, a 38-year-old Mexican citizen was arrested in Olathe, Kansas.
 He has a 2012 conviction for fraud.
 He was issued a warrant of removal and was placed in ICE custody pending removal from the United States.
 Depending on an alien’s criminality, an alien who re-enters the United States after having been previously deported commits a felony punishable by up to 20 years in federal prison, if convicted.
 “The continued results of our deportation officers underscore ICE’s ongoing and steady commitment to public safety,” said Ricardo Wong, field office director for ERO Chicago.
 “As part of this operation, we continue focus on the arrest of individuals who are criminal aliens and public safety threats.
 Because of the tireless efforts of these professional officers, there are fewer criminals in our communities.”

"Sanctuary City Mayor Protected Illegal Alien Mexican Rapist
 
 Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf claims to fight for women.
 Except when she's fighting for their rapists instead.
 A Democratic mayor’s warning to illegal immigrants of an incoming ICE raid in northern California may have led to a number of illegal immigrants with violent and sex-related convictions evading capture and deportation.
 Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf tweeted out an impending warning of the four-day raid last week, alerting targeted individuals to the imminent arrests, and infuriating Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials, who say that many more could have been caught if they hadn't been warned.
 A spokesperson for ICE gave Fox News examples of some of the unsavory characters who evaded officals during the raid.
 One Mexican citizen had convictions for unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor and a conviction for driving under the influence (DUI), and had been deported in 2003.
 Another who evaded capture had a conviction for sodomizing a drugged victim in 2012, as well as a DUI from this year -- that Mexican citizen had also been previously deported in 2013.
 Another illegal immigrant from Mexico, previously deported in 2014 for a conviction for armed robbery, also evaded capture.

"Did Oakland Mayor Tip Off La Raza to ICE Raid?
 
 The story of the Oakland mayor who tipped off illegal alien criminals to ICE raids resulting in rapists and child sex offenders escaping arrest just keeps getting worse.
 Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf shocked the nation when she issued a tweet and press release on February 24 warning about impending ICE raids.
 Schaaf refuses to say how she learned about the ICE raids, only saying it was not from official sources.
 “I felt that it was my duty to share the information,” Schaaf said.
 Whatever the leak pipeline looked like, it's good odds that it began with Obama holdovers ensconced in the government.
 In emails we obtained through a public records request, we didn’t find out who her sources were, but we do know who she was talking to before she made her big announcement.
 Emails reveal that hours before the announcement, a group called Centro Legal de la Raza sent the mayor information on what employers should do in case of an ICE raid.
 Hours before the public was warned about ICE raids, some Oakland businesses got a head start, thanks to the mayor.
 According to emails, the Oakland Indie Alliance, a group of independent businesses, got a message saying “Important Alert!
 Credible information ICE Raids in Oakland Sunday 2/25 and Monday 2/26” and “This information comes directly from the Mayor.”
 Now that last part is significant.
 Because there is no doubt that businesses employing illegal aliens are committing a crime.
 It is unlawful to hire an alien, to recruit an alien, or to refer an alien for a fee, knowing the alien is unauthorized to work in the United States.. An employer can be convicted of the felony of harboring illegal aliens who are his employees if he takes actions in reckless disregard of their illegal status, such as ordering them to obtain false documents, altering records, obstructing INS inspections, or taking other actions that facilitate the alien’s illegal employment.
 Any business that tips off illegal aliens admits that it is aware of their status.
 By passing along the warning, Mayor Schaaf was tipping off criminals committing a felony.

"Illegal Alien Wife Beaters Protected by Sanctuary City Mayor Busted
 
 Sanctuary cities are the real war on women.
 And Democrats are the ones fighting it.
 Democrats like Oakland's Mayor Schaaf.
 Three illegal immigrants, who avoided capture after Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf blew the whistle on a raid by federal immigration authorities last month, have since been re-arrested for new crimes including robbery and spousal abuse, ICE officials said.
 Schaaf tweeted out a warning ahead of the raid in northern California last month, infuriating Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials and the Trump administration.
 “How dare you!” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in California this month, addressing Schaaf.
 “How dare you needlessly endanger the lives of our law enforcement officers to promote a radical, open borders agenda.”
 ICE officials eventually caught 232 illegal immigrants, many of them criminals, in the four-day sweep but said that hundreds more escaped because of Schaaf’s warning.
 But on Tuesday, officials said that at least three of those who were targeted in the raid, but were not apprehended, had since been arrested for additional crimes.
 One was a Mexican national arrested for robbery and gun crimes, who was released back into the community for a prior offense despite an ICE detainer request in November.
 Another Mexican national was arrested for a DUI, despite having been deported three times and prior convictions for false imprisonment, DUI and battery of a spouse.
 The third was a Mexican national who was arrested for corporal injury of a spouse, despite being deported twice and criminal convictions including drug possession, hit-and-run, DUIs, possessions of narcotics equipment and a parole violation.

"Western Michigan ICE operation nets 16 arrests over 4-day period
 
 KALAMAZOO, Mich. – U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) deportation officers arrested 16 individuals for violating federal immigration laws in western Michigan during a four-day targeted enforcement operation that ended Thursday.
 Nine of the immigration violators arrested during the operation were convicted criminals.
 Two individuals illegally re-entered the country after deportation.
 Depending on the alien’s criminal history, an alien who illegally reenters the United States, after having been previously removed, has committed a felony punishable by up to 20 years in federal prison.
 Fourteen men and two women were arrested during the enforcement actions.
 With the exception of a Congolese man, all of those arrested were nationals of Mexico.
 Enforcement activities took place primarily in Berrien, Kalamazoo, St. Joseph, and Van Buren counties.
 “This operation reflects ICE’s commitment to public safety through targeted enforcement efforts,” said Rebecca Adducci, field office director for ERO Detroit.
 “I applaud the brave men and women of ICE who put themselves in harm’s way daily to keep our community safe.”
 Criminal convictions of those arrested include but are not limited to domestic violence, DUI, operating while intoxicated, illegal entry, aggravated assault, assault and battery and carrying a concealed weapon.
 The arrests include:
 · A 19-year-old male Mexican national with a prior conviction for carrying a concealed weapon.
 · A 46-year-old male national of the Democratic Republic of the Congo with convictions for aggravated assault, resisting arrest, and other charges.
 · A 36-year-old male Mexican national with convictions for assault and battery, aggravated assault, and other offenses.
 · A 56-year-old female Mexican national with a federal conviction for illegal entry.
 She is facing federal re-entry after deportation charges.
 All four remain in agency custody.
 The arrestees who are not being federally prosecuted will be processed administratively for removal from the United States.
 Those who have outstanding orders of removal, or who returned to the United States illegally after being deported, are subject to immediate removal from the country.
 The remaining individuals are in ICE custody awaiting a hearing before an immigration judge, or pending travel arrangements for removal in the near future.

"Homeschooling Protects Children from Violence and Marxism
 
 The February mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida prompted many parents to consider homeschooling.
 This is hardly surprising, as the misnamed federal “Gun-Free Schools” law leaves schoolchildren defenseless against mass shooters.
 Removing one’s children from government schools seems a rational response to school shootings.
 School shootings are not the only form of violence causing more parents to consider homeschooling.
 Many potential homeschooling parents are concerned about the failure of school administrators to effectively protect children from bullying by other students.
 Of course, many parents choose homeschooling as a means of protecting their children from federal education “reforms” such as Common Core.
 Other parents are motivated by a desire to protect their children from the cultural Marxism that has infiltrated many schools.

 The spread of cultural Marxism has contributed to the dumbing down of public education.
 Too many government schools are more concerned with promoting political correctness than ensuring that students receive a good education.
 Even if cultural Marxism did not dumb down education, concerns that government schools are indoctrinating children with beliefs that conflict with parents’ political, social, and even religious beliefs would motivate many families to homeschool.
 Even when government schools are not intentionally promoting cultural Marxism or other left-wing ideologies, they are still implicitly biased toward big government.
 For example, how many government schools teach the Austrian economics explanation for the Great Depression — much less question the wisdom of central banking — or critically examine the justifications for America’s hyper-interventionist foreign policy?
 Parents interested in providing their children with a quality education emphasizing the ideas of liberty should consider looking into my homeschooling curriculum.
 The Ron Paul Curriculum provides students with a well-rounded education that includes rigorous programs in history, mathematics, and the physical and natural sciences.
 The curriculum also provides instruction in personal finance.
 Students can develop superior oral and verbal communication skills via intensive writing and public speaking courses.
 Another feature of my curriculum is that it provides students the opportunity to create and run their own internet businesses.
 The government and history sections of the curriculum emphasize Austrian economics, libertarian political theory, and the history of liberty.
 However, unlike government schools, my curriculum never puts ideological indoctrination ahead of education.
 While government schools — and even many private schools — pretend religion played no significant role in history, my curriculum addresses the crucial role religion played in the development of Western civilization.
 However, the materials are drafted in such a way that any Christian, Jewish, Muslim, or atheist parent can feel comfortable using the curriculum.
 Interactive forums allow students to engage with and learn from each other.
 The forums ensure students are actively engaged in their education as well as give them an opportunity to interact with their peers outside of a formal setting.
 Concern about the safety of students in government-run schools is one reason many parents are considering homeschooling, but it is not the only reason.
 Many parents are motivated by a desire to give their children something better than a curriculum that has been dumbed down by federal initiatives like Common Core.
 Other parents do not wish to have their children indoctrinated with views that contradict the parents’ political, social, or even religious beliefs.
 I encourage all parents looking at alternatives to government schools —alternatives that provide children with a well-rounded education that introduces them to the history and ideas of liberty — to go to RonPaulCurriculum.com for more information about my homeschooling program.

"Homeschooling Expands As Parents Seethe Over Liberal Social Engineering And Violence
 
 Homeschooling rates are skyrocketing as parents are continually getting more and more upset at the leftist social engineering taking place in public schools.
 The indoctrination is getting so bad, that some parents are even concerned about liberal violence against those who reject the brainwashing.
 According to The Washington Times, the recent school shooting at Parkland, Florida, was the last straw for scores of parents.
 The paper noted that “the phones started ringing at the Texas Home School Coalition, and they haven’t stopped yet.”
 “When the Parkland shooting happened, our phone calls and emails exploded,” said coalition president Tim Lambert.
 “In the last couple of months, our numbers have doubled.
 We’re dealing with probably between 1,200 and 1,400 calls and emails per month, and prior to that it was 600 to 700.” But according to Natural News, it isn’t just the rampant violence worrying some parents.
 That’s just the tip of the collectivist agenda iceberg.
 Christopher Chin, head of Homeschool Louisiana, told The Times that parents are fed up with “the violence, the bullying, the unsafe environments.” Many parents are also disturbed by the social engineering, which amounts to brainwashing and indoctrination that goes on in a public school.
 For example, a Minnesota public school is forcing Kindergarten students to study ‘white privilege’.
 The left-wing curriculum and common core are also driving parents to remove their children from public schools.
 Brian D. Ray, who heads up the National Home Education Research Institute, in Salem, Oregon, who’s conducted homeschooling research for 33 years, told The Times that concern over school curriculum has reached the top of the charts for most parents.
 Ray said the top three reasons that parents choose homeschooling are a desire to provide religious instruction or different values than those offered in public schools; dissatisfaction with the academic curriculum, and worries about the school environment.
 Since teachers are not allowed to arm themselves to defend their students against the violence often perpetrated at schools simply because they are gun free zones, homeschooling takes care of that problem.
 “Most parents homeschool for more than one reason,” Ray told the paper.
 “But when we ask families why do they homeschool, near the top nowadays is concern about the environment of schools, and that includes safety, pressure to get into drugs, pressure to get into sexual activity.
 It includes all of that.”
 Indoctrination means to teach a person to accept a belief uncritically.
 It’s the very reason the governments of the world still exist.
 People cannot logically and critically understand that hurting people and taking their things is wrong – even if people who declare themselves government is the one doing it.
 Governments are nothing more than a handful of people and have no right to aggress against others.
 But humans are taught at a young age to never question this and that belief has kept most of humanity enslaved for centuries.
 ﻿
 It isn’t a surprise that so many have decided to educate their children themselves.
 And as schools continue to fail, and authoritarian policies continue to wreak havoc on our society, more will wake up to the absolute horror of what allowing the state to educate our children has done to the moral fabric of humanity.

"MAJOR NEW STUDY: Homeschooling Spikes Due to School Violence, Far-Left Bias
 
 According to a 33-year-long study conducted by the National Home Education Research Institute in Oregon, the top three reasons that parents choose homeschooling are a desire to provide religious instruction or different values than those offered in public schools; dissatisfaction with the academic curriculum, and worries about the school environment.
 As reported by The Washington Times, the recent school shooting at Parkland, Fla., was the last straw for scores of parents.
 The paper noted that “the phones started ringing at the Texas Home School Coalition, and they haven’t stopped yet.”
 The Times added:The Lubbock-based organization has been swamped with inquiries for months from parents seeking safer options for their kids in the aftermath of this year’s deadly school massacres, first in Parkland and then in Santa Fe, Texas.
 “When the Parkland shooting happened, our phone calls and emails exploded,” said coalition president Tim Lambert.
 “In the last couple of months, our numbers have doubled.
 We’re dealing with probably between 1,200 and 1,400 calls and emails per month, and prior to that it was 600 to 700.”
 While the debate rages anew over familiar topics following such tragedies — tougher, more restrictive gun control laws and bolstering security at public schools — the revolution in homeschooling has been taking place quietly, behind the scenes and off the radar screens of most political organizations.
 But again, it’s not just the shootings, which admittedly have increased in the past couple of years.
 Christopher Chin, head of Homeschool Louisiana, told The Times that parents are fed up with “the violence, the bullying, the unsafe environments.”
 The Left is driving more kids OUT of public schools
 There is also the Left-wing social engineering.
 The craziness over transgender students and bathrooms/locker rooms, allowing students to “take a knee” during the playing of the National Anthem, the Left-wing curriculum, and refusing to allow students to wear shirts that praise POTUS Trump or feature the American flag are also driving parents into homeschooling.
 REMNANT COMMENT: We here at The Remnant are always eager to promote the home-schooling movement, and this report helps illustrate why.
 At the moment and personally speaking, my own family’s home-school is going great guns.
 We have a daughter still in high school and three in grade school.
 Our family couldn't be happier with our decision to homeschool---yes, all the way through high school.
 And as for our older home-schooled children: My third-eldest child is preparing to head off to college in the fall.
 Her older sister just finished a semester studying in Austria and will graduate with a double major and a minor degree next spring.
 My son will be a junior this fall, working on a Mass Communications degree at Franciscan University.
 Here's an example of his work:
 Perhaps this video from a couple of years ago will be useful to those considering home-schooling this fall:
 Friends, please give serious thought and prayer to home-schooling your children.
 I realize it’s a challenge, but few challenges have greater payoffs in this world or the next.
 There is no better way to keep the Catholic family together and committed to the Catholic restoration than the Catholic home school.

"Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’
 
 Outside of specialists and seekers, the only reason why there is general interest in the Qur’an among non-Muslims is to seek an answer to the question of whether or not it justifies and encourages Islamic terrorism.
 With What the Qur’an Meant: And Why It Matters, religion author Garry Wills is here to reassure us:
 What did the scripture of Islam tell me about the duty to kill infidels?
 Some people are sure it is there, though it isn’t.
 Then what does it say about Shari’ah law?
 Not a thing (p. 7).
 That would be good to know, were Wills a reliable witness.
 Unfortunately, he proves to be just the opposite: Wills laments “Robert Spencer of Jihad Watch calling for a ban on the Qur’an” (p. 58).
 I have never called for such a ban, and oppose in principle the banning of any book.
 Wills, not surprisingly, does not offer any quotation from me to back up his false claim.
 His manifest unreliability on this point casts a shadow on his primary assertions about the Qur’an.
 Wills seems determined to put the best possible face on the Qur’an, which requires him to ignore a great deal of Qur’anic incitement and hatred.
 For example, he quotes 5:51 -- “You who believe, do not take the Jews and Christians as allies” (p. 114) -- but he nonetheless concludes, after ten pages of tu quoque arguments and other legerdemain, that “the Qur’an is fraternal in its treatment of other faiths” (p. 124).
 Wills never mentions Qur’an 9:29, which commands Muslims to wage war against Jews and Christians and subjugate them as inferiors under the rule of Sharia.
 Wills is no more trustworthy when he deals with the question of violence in the Qur’an.
 He renders one key passage in this way: “Fight then until there is no more persecution, and worship [at the shrine] is devoted to God” (2:193; p. 133).
 Whence the bracketed interpolation “at the shrine”?
 Wills doesn’t give any source for it; apparently it comes from none other than Garry Wills himself.
 By adding “at the shrine” to this verse, Wills restricts the call to fight to the area around the Sacred Mosque in Mecca.
 He ignores the fact that some Islamic authorities see this passage as calling for nothing less than unlimited warfare against non-Muslims.
 The prominent Twentieth Century Indian Islamic scholar Muhammad Ashiq Ilahi Bulandshahri explains the passage this way:
 The worst of sins are Infidelity ( Kufr) and Polytheism ( shirk) which constitute rebellion against Allah, The Creator.
 To eradicate these, Muslims are required to wage war until there exists none of it in the world, and the only religion is that of Allah.
 Wills doesn’t mention the existence of such interpretations, even to dismiss them.
 Likewise, when he claims that the Qur’an has “not a thing” to say about Sharia, he appears unaware that the Qur’an is one of the sources of Sharia.
 The Qur’an’s declarations that a woman’s testimony is worth half that of a man’s (2:282), that a daughter is to receive a smaller part of an inheritance than a son receives (4:11), that thieves are to have their hands amputated (5:38), and that those who “wage war against Allah and his messenger” are to be crucified or have a hand and foot amputated on opposite sides (5:33) are part of Sharia in all its various expressions.
 Because these stipulations are found in the Qur’an, they cannot be questioned or set aside.
 Throughout his book, Wills’ assurances that the Qur’an is not really as bad as “right-wing Islamophobes” say, or that the Bible contains material that is just as bad or worse, dissolve under close scrutiny.
 Again and again it turns out that Wills has ignored key passages in order to make his case.
 He asks why the Qur’an is “so ferocious to ‘hypocrites’ and apostates” (p. 124).
 Then he offers a quotation from the New Testament Letter to the Hebrews saying that “if we sin again on purpose” there is “only a terrifying judgment to come” (p. 126).
 Wills concludes: “The Qur’an is not as absolute as this, because it always leaves room for God’s inexhaustible mercy and forgiveness” (p. 126).
 That sounds wonderful, and certainly pleasing to multicultural ears to learn that the Qur’an is more merciful than the New Testament.
 Until one realizes that, in his discussion of apostasy in the Qur’an, Wills has omitted all mention of the primary Qur’anic passage on this topic:

 They wish you would disbelieve as they disbelieved so you would be alike.
 So do not take from among them allies until they emigrate for the cause of Allah.
 But if they turn away, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them and take not from among them any ally or helper (4:89).
 To “emigrate in the cause of Allah” is to leave one’s home and join up with the Muslims.
 This passage envisions some of the disbelievers becoming Muslim, and then turning away again, whereupon the Muslims are told to “kill them wherever you find them.” God’s inexhaustible mercy, indeed.
 Wills’ peaceful fantasy Qur’an raises one massive question that the author does not and cannot answer: if the Islamic holy book is really as peaceful and benign as Garry Wills makes it out to be, why do so very many Muslims worldwide misunderstand it?
 The Islamic State (ISIS), in its heyday, quoted the Qur’an frequently -- odd behavior if the group actually was ignorant of, indifferent to, or in violation of the book’s core tenets.
 ISIS quoted the Qur’an extensively in threats to blow up the White House and conquer Rome and Spain; in explaining its priorities in the nations it is targeting in jihad; in preaching to Christians after collecting the jizya (a Qur’an-based tax, cf.
 Qur’an 9:29); in justifying the execution of accused spies; and in its various videos.
 ISIS also awarded $10,000 prizes and sex slaves in Qur’an memorization contests.
 One of its underground lairs was found littered with weapons and copies of the Qur’an.
 Children in the Islamic State study the Qur’an and get weapons training.
 One Malaysian Muslim said that the Qur’an led him to join the Islamic State.
 A Muslima in the U.S. promoted the Islamic State by quoting the Qur’an.
 An Islamic State propagandist’s parents said of him: “Our son is a devout Muslim.
 He had learnt the Quran by heart.” A Muslim politician from Jordan said that the Islamic State’s “doctrine stems from the Qur’an and Sunnah.”
 How would Garry Wills explain all that?
 He can’t; he has just explained all Qur’anic violence and intolerance away, leaving the manifest fact that all too many Muslims worldwide think that the Qur’an says exactly what he claims it does not say an unanswered conundrum.
 Wills’ naïve, inaccurate, misleadingly sunny view of the Qur’an, of course, accords with that of his fellow Leftist Catholic, Pope Francis.
 Francis has proclaimedpreposterously that “authentic Islam and the proper reading of the Koran are opposed to every form of violence.” Wills’ book accords well with the present-day Catholic Church’s head-in-the-sand posture toward Qur’an-based Islamic jihad violence and the Muslim persecution of the ancient Christian communities of the Middle East.
 It isn’t remotely accurate, but it feels good, and for the Catholic and Leftist establishment today, that seems to be all that matters.

"Stop Comparing Immigration Enforcement to the Holocaust
 
 The media has 2 very simple rules for Holocaust analogies.
 1.
 The Muslim Brotherhood's leaders praising Hitler, calling for another Holocaust and killing Jews is nothing like the Holocaust.
 And only shameless Zionists would attempt to equate killing Jews with killing Jews.
 2.
 Anything a Republican president does is exactly like the Holocaust.
 A former CIA director compared US immigration policy to Nazi Germany in an ominous Tweet.
 “Other governments have separated mothers and children,” Former CIA and NSA chief Michael Hayden wrote on Saturday, along with a black and white photo of the Birkenau concentration and death-camp in Poland.
 Then Hayden doubled down on that analogy.
 It's particularly stupid of Michael Hayden to make that analogy because during the Bush years, the agencies he ran were compared to Nazi Germany.
 Repeatedly.
 You might think that would have cured him of facile Nazi analogies.
 But instead it seems to have whetted his appetite for making them.
 Yes, the Nazi arrested people, asked them for ID, split up families and... then killed them all.
 That's the really relevant part.
 Every country arrests people.
 Just about every country splits up families when they arrest the parents.
 That's not unique.
 Selecting the Jews, based on race, for extermination is more of the reason why the term Nazi is not a positive one.
 Hayden's thoughtless tweet can just as easily be used to delegitimize any and all law enforcement.
 The attacks here are motivated by a desire for open borders.
 Children are being used as human shields in a campaign to end national security forever.

"Nigel Farage Warns “We’ll Lose” A Battle Between the West and Islam
 
 British politician Nigel Farage once helped convince Britons to vote for Brexit and separate from the European Union, but British establishment politicians have done everything they could to sabotage that vote since then.
 Now Farage has apparently decided that if he can’t beat them, he’ll join them — if not on Brexit, then in their stance of denial and appeasement regarding the global jihad threat.’
 At a recent dinner of the UK Independence Party (UKIP), which he formerly headed, Farage said: “If dealing with Islamic fundamentalism becomes a battle between us and the entire religion, I’ll tell you the result: we’ll lose.
 We will simply lose….We absolutely have to get that Muslim majority living in many of our towns and cities on our side, more attuned to Western values than some pretty hardline interpretations of the Qur’an.”
 Sure.
 Now how does Farage propose to do that?
 His warning against making the resistance to jihad a “battle between us and the entire religion” is odd.
 No sane person is saying that the West should go to war with the entire Islamic world.
 The likeliest interpretation of his statement is that he is saying that we must not speak about how jihadis find justification for their actions in the Qur’an and Sunnah, as that will alienate the “moderates.”

 But if we don’t speak about such facts, how will we ever convince Muslims not to follow “hardline interpretations of the Qur’an”?
 Another problem with Farage’s statement is that it manifests a remarkable ignorance of history.
 While he is deeply concerned that British people not begin to think that resisting jihad terror means that they are in a “battle” with the “entire religion” of Islam, he appears unaware of the fact that many Muslims throughout history have considered their entire religion to be at war with the entire non-Muslim world.
 I document this abundantly in my new book The History of Jihad From Muhammad to ISIS .
 To take one of innumerable examples, Sharaf ad-Din Ali Yazdi, a fifteenth-century Persian who wrote a biography of the Mongol Muslim warrior Tamerlane, observed that “the Qur’an says the highest dignity man can attain is that of making war in person against the enemies of his religion.
 Muhammad advises the same thing, according to the tradition of the Muslim doctors: wherefore the great Temur always strove to exterminate the infidels, as much to acquire that glory, as to signalise himself by the greatness of his conquests.”
 After conquest came dhimmitude, the subjugated status that the Qur’an mandates for “the People of the Book” (primarily Jews and Christians).
 In the early twelfth century, the Fatimid caliph Al-Amir bi-Ahkamillah issued this edict:
 Now, the prior degradation of the infidels in this world before the life to come—where it is their lot—is considered an act of piety; and the imposition of their poll tax [jizya], “until they pay the tribute out of hand and have been humbled” (Koran 9:29) is a divinely ordained obligation….The dhimmi’s payment of his dues by a bill drawn on a Muslim, or by delegating a real believer to pay it in his name will not be tolerated.
 It must be exacted from him directly in order to vilify and humiliate him, so that Islam and its people may be exalted and the race of infidels brought low.
 The jizya is to be imposed on all of them in full, without exception.
 Underlying this subjugation is a deep contempt for non-Muslims.
 In the year 718, the Umayyad caliph Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz sent out a message to the governors of the various Islamic provinces:
 O you who believe!
 The non-Muslims are nothing but dirt.
 Allah has created them to be partisans of Satan; most treacherous in regard to all they do; whose whole endeavor in this nether life is useless, though they themselves imagine that they are doing fine work.
 Upon them rests the curse of Allah, of the Angels and of man collectively
 We must not think that we are at war with the entire religion.
 But what, Mr. Farage, are we to think about the Muslims who consider themselves and their religion to be at war with us?
 Nigel Farage has become just another mainstream hack politician.

"The Obama Era Jade Helm Connection To The Current Illegal Immigration Policy
 
 On the surface, the latest illegal immigration debate between Leftists and the Administration looks like, yet another issue Progressives are trying to undermine progress being done by the president.
 No one should be surprised by the crackdown on illegals entering the country, especially since it was one of the major campaign promises Donald Trump made before getting elected.
 When it comes to the separation of children from their families, there is nothing new today that was not being done during the Obama reign.
 In 2013, Obama began bringing into the US literally over a hundred thousand people, mainly below age 21.
 They were bused, flown, and met at the US border with Mexico by the Department of Homeland Security under the direction of Obama to do so.
 Since most of them were adolescents and older teenagers they could not be set free, thus Obama ordered various military bases to house these children.

 The surge of children into the US from various countries south of the border was said to be the result of economics, high crime rates, and actual threats from organized crime entities.
 Another excuse used by the Obama government was to bring them here to find their families already in the US.
 Thus, the idea that separating children from their parents as being something new, done only by the Trump Administration is absurd, since we really have no idea whether the children brought here during the Obama reign were intentionally separated from their parents by the US government at that time, or not.
 We have only what little information the government told us then, which was not very much, considering the fact that Obama wanted to keep as much of this situation as secret as possible.
 What many do not realize is, today's policy of separating underage siblings from their parents once they cross the border illegally into the US seems to be a planned event by the US government going all the way back to the domestic military exercises known as Jade Helm in 2015.
 Many remember the military taking over several Walmart locations, mainly in Texas, during the Jade Helm exercises.
 This, along with the federal government grab of millions of acres of land during the Obama years, speaks volumes in the government's plan to be able to handle millions of people.
 Since Obama planned to have over a million Muslim refugees brought into the US over a short period of time, along with the hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants coming in, one can understand the reason the Feds had to have the Walmart stores and so much land, as they needed housing for the millions they planned to bring in.
 Despite President Trump signing an Executive Order suspending Syrian refugees from entering the US for 120 days on Jan. 26, 2017 while security measures were reviewed, the US still imported 110,000 refugees from Syria and various other countries into the US in 2017 alone, up from 85,000 the previous year.
 These numbers follow Obama's projections of the expected amount of refugees permitted to come to the US.
 Of course, as with the number of illegal immigrants entering our county, the Feds downplay the actual number which always ends up to be more than quadruple their stated number.
 What we seem to have here with the illegal immigration situation today is some very good actors on the Left accusing the Trump Administration of being cruel and insensitive with separating children from their families once they cross the Mexican border into the US.
 When in fact, their idol, Obama did the same thing for years during his time in power.
 What they do not want to admit to is the fact that today's illegal immigration picture is one that follows the Obama plan on dealing with the influx of illegals to a carbon copy.
 President Trump, on the other hand, is following along with it by detaining illegal immigrants at the border and separating children from their apparent families.
 Since no one can know if the children really belong to the illegals who say they are their parents, they are separated until that can be verified, along with other background findings.
 The bottom line is, both the Left and the Trump Administration seem to be following along with a plan of action going back to Jade Helm which paved the way for the housing needed for such a huge influx of illegal immigrants and refugees.
 All of which seems to be a planned event.
 In any case, neither side in DC is really interested in solving the illegal immigration problem or cares about the children involved.
 If they were, there would be no detention and separation after illegally coming into the US, only an immediate deportation by US Border Patrol on the spot.

"Muslim Cleric: “There Were Jews In Islamic Countries & Caliphates, But We Never Killed Them Just For Being Jews”
 
 When he says that Muslims never killed Jews just for being Jews, he is lying, and relying on the historical ignorance of his audience.
 In my new book The History of Jihad From Muhammad to ISIS , I detail many instances in which Muslims did exactly that.
 In 1013, Berbers from North Africa entered Spain and took Córdoba in 1013, they began massacring Jews, and initiated a wholesale slaughter of Jews in Granada.
 And again in 1066, rioting Muslims, enraged by the humiliation of a Jew who had been appointed to rule over Muslims, murdered four thousand Jews in Granada.

 The twelfth-century Muslim historian Ibn Baydhaq detailed how the Almohads treated the Jews as they advanced:
 Abd al-Mumin…the leader of the Almohads after the death of Muhammad ibn Tumart the Mahdi…captured Tlemcen [in the Maghreb] and killed all those who were in it, including the Jews, except those who embraced Islam….
 [In Sijilmasa] one hundred and fifty persons were killed for clinging to their [Jewish] faith….
 All the cities in the Almoravid state were conquered by the Almohads.
 One hundred thousand persons were killed in Fez on that occasion, and 120,000 in Marrakesh.
 The Jews in all [Maghreb] localities [conquered]…groaned under the heavy yoke of the Almohads; many had been killed, many others converted; none were able to appear in public as Jews.

 ""Kuwaiti Cleric Sheikh Jihad Al-‘Ayesh Denies the Holocaust and the Existence of Gas Chambers: How Big a Bakery Would You Need to Make 50,000 Loaves of Bread?,” MEMRI, May 26, 2018:
 Kuwaiti cleric Sheikh Jihad Al-‘Ayesh delivered a speech in which he said that the figure of six million Jews killed in the Holocaust was a “historical lie,” but that Hitler “knew the truth about the Jews” and therefore began “tormenting and persecuting them.” “The Jews were banished, tortured and annihilated because of their deeds.
 They were not banished for being Jews,” he said.
 In an effort to dispute the existence of gas chambers at Auschwitz, Sheikh Al-‘Ayesh, who heads the Bait Al-Maqdis Documentary Studies Center, drew the following analogy: “Imagine that you want to build a bakery.
 What size of bakery would you need to make 10,000 loaves of bread?… What if you wanted to make 50,000 loaves of bread an hour?
 You would need a larger bakery.
 How many ovens would you need to burn six million human beings?” Sheikh Al-‘Ayesh’s posted his address on his personal YouTube channel on May 26.
 The video was also posted on the Facebook account of Bait Al-Maqdis Documentary Studies Center.
 Following is a transcript: Jihad Al-‘Ayesh: “Some people have shown up with a new fashion.
 We used to think that fashion has to do with haircuts, clothes, or lifestyle, but the vogue today is to sympathize with the Jews and to shed crocodile tears about their sorrows, their heresy, and their historical lies.
 This is, indeed, a new fashion.
 Some esteemed people shed tears about what the Jews call ‘the Holocaust.’ […] “Did the Nazi annihilation – the Holocaust – target only the Jews?
 Anybody?
 The Jews claim that it happened to them alone and that the number of Jews who died in that Holocaust was six million.
 What we have here are historical errors.
 First of all, the figure of six million is a historical lie.
 In addition, claiming that it happened to the Jews alone excludes the non-Jews who were tortured by Hitler.
 So was it annihilation?
 Yes, it was.
 Who did Hitler annihilate?
 He annihilated a group of races and people, some of whom were even German.
 Hitler annihilated 400,000 Germans who were handicapped or suffered from chronic diseases.
 Hitler did not annihilate the Jews only.
 […] “Hitler was not the first in the West to perpetrate a genocide.
 Inhuman and criminal annihilation runs in the veins of many in the West.
 Hitler embodies one type of modern Western annihilation.
 When the Americans occupied the republics of the Indians, they annihilated millions of human beings.
 It is said that they annihilated 50-100 hundred million, but nobody ever mentions this.
 […] “Was there annihilation?
 Yes.
 Many races were annihilated.
 The Auschwitz camp, which is in southern Poland, was a major and exceptional camp for detention, torture, and forced labor.
 Many people were tortured and were starved to death there.
 […] “The Jews were banished, tortured, and annihilated because of their deeds.
 They were not banished for being Jews.
 There were Jews in the Islamic countries and caliphates as well, but we never killed them just for being Jews.
 No, it never happened.
 Hitler and the Nazi state knew the truth about the Jews, and therefore, they began tormenting and persecuting them.
 […] “That is when the Final Solution began.
 The Nazis called it the ‘Final Solution’ of the Jews.
 When we say ‘Final Solution,’ we realize that many of the terms used by the Zionist state constitute Nazi terms, ideas, and notions.
 It is as if they are two faces of the same coin.
 […] “Since Germany and Europe did not want the Jews, the Nazis came up with the idea of sending the Jews to another country.
 The Nazis suggested Madagascar, Ecuador, or an Arab country – Syria.
 But after a while, the Nazis discovered that there were groups of Jews calling for the establishment of a state.
 They were calling for a Zionist state.
 That is when the idea of deporting the Jews to Palestine arose….

"President Donald Trump Proposes ""Simple Immigration Plan"": Illegals Have To Go!
 
 On Monday, President Donald Trump proposed what he sees as an ideal immigration plan during a meeting with the King and Queen of Jordan at the White House.
 “We want a system where when people come in illegally, they have to go out,” Trump told reporters.
 “A nice simple system that works.”
 Trump said that the system that Mexico uses to deal with illegals by holding them a few hours and then sending them away is preferable to how the long, drawn out process in the united States is conducted.

 I completely agree.
 In fact, I've often said if we catch people close to the border, we should not even bring them into the system if they are not citizens, but walk them back over the border and make sure they keep walking.
 Often, by putting illegals into the system, it takes years to deport them, which costs the American people lots of money.
 That system would require more judges to handle more illegals and Trump ripped the calls for more judges in favor of a more ""simple immigration plan.""
 “We want strong borders and we want no crime,” Trump said.
 “The Democrats want open borders and they don’t care about crime.”
 Trump then called on Congress to correct the problems created by legislation with more legislation.
 “The laws are obsolete, the laws are horrible, having to do with the border, both in terms of security and in terms of taking care of people,” he said.
 “We want children staying together,” Trump said, blasting the New York Times report that said he didn't really want to sign his executive order last week that would keep families together in detention while they awaited the judicial process.
 Of course, Trump has inherited a problem that has existed for several administrations, both Republican and Democrat, for decades.
 It is time that Congress sure up things so that America's tax dollars are not bound up in a worthless judicial process when people are clearly in the country illegally.
 Sadly, too many people want more amnesty which begs the question if any of them take the law seriously in the first place.

"Catholic bishop purges the names of his predecessors from church buildings for failing to protect children
 
 On Wednesday, Bishop Ronald Gainer of the Catholic diocese of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, ordered that the names of all previous Harrisburg bishops from the past seven decades be removed from church buildings and rooms, because they collectively failed to protect children from dozens of predators priests and other Catholic leaders.
 No other Catholic prelate has conducted such a blanket purge of his predecessors' legacies, The New York Times reports.

 At the same time, Gainer released the names of 71 clergy and seminarians who've been credibly accused of sexual misconduct involving children dating back to 1947, apologized on behalf of the diocese and himself, waived any confidentiality agreements abuse survivors may have signed in legal settlements with the diocese, and released new guidelines for protecting children in the church.
 Grainer said he wanted to release the list of accused predators earlier but was asked to wait until a state grand jury inquiry into abuse in six Pennsylvania Catholic diocese, including Harrisburg, was complete.
 A spokesman for Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, who ordered the two-year investigation of Catholic sex abuse, said the Harrisburg diocese had pushed to end the grand jury investigation last year.
 The grand jury's findings, including allegations against more than 300 priests accused of sexual abuse dating back to 1947, will likely be released this month after the state Supreme Court gave the green light.
 The Catholic Church is already reeling over the revelations that former Washington Archbishop Theodore McCormick, who resigned as a cardinal over the weekend after being sanctioned by Pope Francis, has been credibly accused of sexually abusing at least two boys decades ago.
 McCarrick, 88, faces a trial at the Vatican and has been barred from saying public Mass.

"Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal
 
 Archbishop Bernard Hebda of St. Paul, MN, responds to the McCarrick scandal (The Catholic Spirit):
 Every time Mass is celebrated, the priest prays that Jesus will “look not on our sins but on the faith of [his] Church… .” That’s been an important prayer for me in the time that I have been serving this archdiocese, well aware of our sins but equally aware of the strong and vibrant faith of this local Church.
 I’ve been praying that prayer even more earnestly in these past weeks as the Church in the United States has once again come face-to-face with its sins, with reports that former cardinal Theodore McCarrick, one of the most prominent Churchmen in the United States in the last quarter century, has been accused of abusing two minors and sexually harassing or assaulting a number of seminarians and young priests.
 To make matters worse (if that is even possible), evidence has surfaced that indicates that a bishop, as well as some priests and laity, had brought the allegations about misconduct with seminarians to the attention of Church authorities but to no avail: Archbishop McCarrick was nonetheless “promoted” to become the archbishop in our nation’s capital, and elevated to the College of Cardinals.
 While I realize that it is not always easy to evaluate the credibility of those bringing allegations, and that there’s often a tendency to believe those we know over those we don’t, I don’t think that the Church in the United States will rest — and confidence will be restored — until the matter is independently investigated and explained, and assurances are given that there are safeguards in place to make sure that something like this couldn’t happen again.
 The matter has been particularly troubling to me personally due to the fact that I had served in the Archdiocese of Newark as coadjutor archbishop from November 4, 2013, to March 25, 2016, when I was named archbishop here.
 It was while I was in Newark that I was introduced to then-Cardinal McCarrick.
 A number of good Catholics have written to ask for a personal accounting on my part, inquiring whether I was made aware in my time in Newark of the 2005 and 2007 settlements involving Archbishop McCarrick, or if I knew of any allegations against him.
 I can state unequivocally that I learned of those settlements only in June of this year, as news broke about the unrelated claim that had been filed in the Archdiocese of New York.
 What I know of the settlements I know from the newspapers.
 When serving in Newark, I was regularly briefed on current legal matters of all sorts, but not on past legal matters (unless they were still being discussed in the press).
 By the time I arrived in Newark in November 2013, the 2005 and 2007 settlements were apparently considered ancient history.
 It would be untrue to state that I had never heard any allegations about Cardinal McCarrick.
 Years before I ever lived in Newark, and never imagining that I would be assigned there, I had indeed read — as a somewhat geeky ex-lawyer — an allegation about Cardinal McCarrick in the context of a 2005 lawsuit in the Southern District of New York against Archbishop Myers, Cardinal Eagan, Bishop Hubbard and the Irish Christian Brothers.
 While the complaint didn’t supply any details, the plaintiff was reported to have said to a journalist that “Archbishop McCarrick would share a bed with seminarians but not engage in any activity with them.” The complaint would later be formally amended to include that allegation.
 Knowing, however, that this lawsuit was completely dismissed by the state and federal courts, I never gave the particular allegation about Cardinal McCarrick any credence.
 I can also state without exception that no one in my years in Newark ever told me that they were improperly touched by Archbishop McCarrick, and no one ever told me that they had to share a bed with him or that they had seen anyone share a bed with him.
 I heard lots of gut-wrenching stories in my two-and-a-half years there, but none of them involved Archbishop McCarrick.
 With St. John Paul II’s 1995 visit, he was remembered for “bringing a saint to Newark,” not as an abuser of seminarians, minors or priests.
 When I was installed here in St. Paul, he joined me at lunch along with my father, sister, godmother and then 12-year-old nephew.
 I can assure you that I would never have allowed that to happen if I had any reason to know or even suspect the things that have been reported in the newspapers this past month.
 While the letters and emails of recent days are sober reminders that there’s still a long way to go in restoring trust, I nonetheless welcome the efforts to hold me accountable to you, the faithful of this archdiocese.
 The events of these past weeks have shown that no one can be above the law, regardless of rank or privilege.
 I was grateful for the opportunity to reinforce that with our seminarians this past weekend, and I look forward to continuing my work with the Office of Ministerial Standards and Safe Environment, and our Archdiocesan Review Board, in creating a culture in which no one need be afraid or reluctant to bring forth an allegation of misconduct.
 Our heavenly patron, St. Paul, reminds us that “where sin abounds, grace abounds all the more.” May these difficult days be days of great grace for this local Church.
 REMNANT COMMENT: While we certainly appreciate His Excellency's candid explanation of what he knew and did not know about this horrific scandal in the Church, we would also humbly beg him to take it one step further by publicly proclaiming his profession of belief in the Church's official teaching against the mortal sin of homosexual acts and the so-called ""gay lifestyle,"" which includes her long-held teaching that homosexual activity between clerics is an ecclesiastical crime.
 Far from being reassured of this by their bishops, many Catholic faithful today are informed that the modern Catholic Church is now an ""inclusive community"" that ""welcomes all"" and ""judges none.""
 All very well and good, except for the fact that the Church's constant and unchanging moral teaching on this makes no such allowance.
 In fact, this binding and constant teaching of the Church was reaffirmed most recently in her most authoritative modern catechism, which holds the exact opposite position from that apparently held by many bishops:
 Homosexuality refers to relations between men or between women who experience an exclusive or predominant sexual attraction toward persons of the same sex... Basing itself on Sacred Scripture, which presents homosexual acts as acts of grave depravity, tradition has always declared that ""homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered.""
 They are contrary to the natural law.
 They close the sexual act to the gift of life.
 They do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity.
 Under no circumstances can they be approved.
 (Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2357)
 Under no circumstances…except for those dreamed up by a number of bishops in this country who apparently think that it should be left up to individual parishes to decide if they are LGBTQ-friendly or not.
 Even Pope John Paul ""The GREAT's"" Vatican clarified the Church's teaching on October 31, 1986, in the “Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons”:
 Although the particular inclination of the homosexual person is not a sin, it is a more or less strong tendency ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil; thus the inclination itself must be seen as an objective disorder.
 Therefore special concern and pastoral attention should be directed to those who have this condition, lest they be led to believe that the living out of this orientation in homosexual activity is a morally acceptable option.
 It is not.
 Notice the late pope does not say, “Let the practicing homosexuals have a spiritual home among your faithful,” as Father James Martin and his episcopal fans are at least implying on a regular basis in the media.
 Does Archbishop Hebda believe it is time for the Church to stop humiliating herself by stooping to accommodate a special interest group that obviously doesn't care about her or the moral code by which she governs?
 Does he believe that all Catholics must follow the rules of the Church pertaining to the Sixth Commandment...or just the straight Catholics?
 Does His Excellency believe that if some homosexual Catholics feel they need not bother following the rules they should be warmly welcomed into our ""Catholic Christian"" community anyway, even if they are in same-sex unions?
 Pope John Paul certainly didn't accept that.
 In his 2005 book Memory and Identity, John Paul referred to homosexuality as an “ideology of evil,” insisting of so-called 'gay marriage' that:
 “It is legitimate and necessary to ask oneself if this is not perhaps part of a new ideology of evil, perhaps more insidious and hidden, which attempts to pit human rights against the family and man.”
 Was Pope John Paul THE GREAT an intolerant homophobe?
 Are Father Martin and his pals in the episcopacy really so enlightened over every pope, saint, and moral theologian in history?
 Or is it not so that it is both negligent and uncharitable for some bishops to refuse to inform their faithful that according to the Church's own infallible teaching, everlasting damnation is the price to be paid for this kind of inclusivity and toleration?
 And if the episcopal retort is going to be that this acceptance refers only to chaste homosexuals, then we call FOUL even louder since this crosses the line into willful deception.
 We're all sinners, of course--- and the Church already accepts repentant homosexuals as they are, just as she accepts repentant practitioners of ANY sins of the flesh.
 So why are our bishops playing dumb?
 Quite obviously, it is because what they are actually closing an episcopal eye to are the folks who want to keep right on sinning--and sinning proudly.
 This is what the Church of Accompaniment is all about!
 But, practically speaking--in the real world--this kind of ""accompaniment"" is only green-lighting vice and mortal sin, and as such constitutes a hideous violation of everything these bishops supposedly believe as Catholic priests.
 So what's going on here?
 Who are these bishops that think they can play fast and loose not only with the moral theology of the Catholic Church, but also with the immortal souls of their flock?
 Is it any wonder that priests and laity alike are changing their attitude on the ""gay lifestyle"" and violations of the Sixth Commandment when so many bishops are working to remove the stigma attached to this sin that Scripture tells us cries to heaven for vengeance?
 The Catholic Church's new-found ""climate of tolerance"" is exactly what McCarrick and company are counting on!
 It is truly homophobic for any bishop to lie to the gay community about this, and to risk the immortal souls of the sheep merely so that the shepherd might pride himself on occupying the politically correct high ground.
 This is gross dereliction of duty, and we hope and pray that all the good U.S. bishops would jump at the opportunity to issue statements reaffirming the Church's clear teaching against all sins of the flesh, homo- and heterosexual.
 Again, God bless Archbishop Hebda for this welcome statement, and may God grant him the courage now to finish the task by publicly reassuring the scandalized faithful that it’s not just abuse of minors or sexual harassment that’s going on here.
 Our bishops must make it absolutely clear that the Church's moral theology on homosexuality will not and can not be trumped by the dictates of political correctness.
 And neither can God's law be changed to accommodate the spirit of our “most enlightened” age---which is, of course, an evil spirit that can be driven out only by prayer and fasting.
 Until the Church and her bishops get back to reaffirming traditional Catholic teaching on human sexuality we can forget about seeing an end to the sexual abuse crisis and the massive problem of homosexuality in the clergy.
 McCarrick will become the norm, not the exception, and confidence in the leadership and moral authority of the Catholic Church will remain in the toilet indefinitely... exactly as the forces of darkness intended all along.

"Hundreds of Priests Accused in Pennsylvania, Church of Accompaniment in Crisis
 
 The Pennsylvania Supreme Court on Tuesday released a sweeping grand jury report on sex abuse in the Catholic Church, listing hundreds of accused clergy and detailing 70 years of misconduct and church response across the state.
 
 The release is the culmination of an 18-month probe, led by state Attorney General Josh Shapiro, on six of the state’s eight dioceses — Harrisburg, Pittsburgh, Allentown, Scranton, Erie and Greensburg — and follows other state grand jury reports that revealed abuse and coverups in two other dioceses.
 
 Some details and names that might reveal the 300 clergy listed have been redacted from the report.
 Legal challenges by clergy delayed the report’s release, after some said it is a violation of their constitutional rights.
 Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court ruled last month that the report must be released but with some redaction.
 
 The report’s release begins an information war, with prosecutors and many victims saying it’s the start of holding church leaders at the top accountable for the first time, while church lawyers and other advocates for the institution say the report depicts an era of another century, unfairly smearing today’s Catholicism in Pennsylvania.
 
 The report has helped renew a crisis many in the church thought and hoped had ended nearly 20 years ago after the scandal erupted in Boston.
 But recent abuse-related scandals, from Chile to Australia, have reopened wounding questions about accountability and whether church officials are still covering up crimes at the highest levels.
 
 The new wave of allegations has called Pope Francis’s handling of abuse into question as many Catholics look to him to help the church regain its credibility.
 The pope’s track record has been mixed, something some outsiders attribute to his learning curve or shortcomings and others chalk up to resistance from a notoriously change-averse institution.
 
 The Pennsylvania grand jury report follows the resignation last month of Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, a towering figure in the U.S. church and former D.C. archbishop who was accused of sexually abusing minors and adults for decades.
 Both have further polarized the church on homosexuality, celibacy and whether laypeople should have more power.
 It has also triggered debate about whether statutes of limitations should be expanded.
 
 “We’re dealing with a long-term struggle not only about the meaning of justice, but about the meaning of memory,” said Jason Berry, a reporter and author who has covered the sexual abuse crisis for decades.
 “And how honest the church has been about this crisis.
 Most bishops, besides apologies, have not been on the cutting edge of change.”
 
 Church officials began bracing for the aftermath of the report.
 On Monday, D.C.’s archbishop, Cardinal Donald Wuerl, former longtime leader of the Pittsburgh diocese, warned his priests in a letter that the probe will be “profoundly disturbing.”
 REMNANT COMMENT: The report also shows that “more than 90 ‘offenders’ will be listed” in Donald Cardinal Wuerl’s former diocese, which is ironic since Wuerl is one of Pope Francis’s closest U.S. advisers and sits on the Vatican’s bishop oversight committee.
 Well played, Cardinal Wuerl!
 So, let me get this straight (I know, lots of luck with that one): These are the people that are going to ""accompany us"" and our children in the ""synodal Church"" with its new orientation, overseen by a ""God of Surprises"" who is uber-merciful and doesn't judge, and headed up by a pope who, according to Father Thomas Rosica, ""breaks Catholic traditions whenever he wants, because he is 'free from disordered attachments'?''
 You don't say!
 All this and rampant homosexuality in the priesthood, too... along with a ""trivialized liturgy"" (according to Pope Benedict XVI) and widespread apostasy among the faithful?
 Remind me again: What exactly has Vatican II and the last fifty years of aggiornamento given us?
 Because I can't seem to think of a darn thing, apart from heretical homilies, sodomitical clergy and an increasingly lavender liturgy.
 You know what, guys?
 Thanks, but no thanks.
 You can take your 'Church of Accompaniment"" to prison with you.
 I'd sooner let my kids be accompanied by fans of the Oakland Raiders than turn them over to you... meaning no disrespect to fans of the Oakland Raiders, of course.

"Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus
 
 Editor’s Note: Over the years, Bishop Robert Morlino of the Diocese of Madison has confirmed several of my children according to the traditional Rite of Confirmation, as his diocese has been a port in the storm for many displaced and disillusioned Catholic families.
 We don’t see eye-to-eye on everything, of course, but his faith and pastoral solicitude have for us been a light in the darkness and proof that God has not left us orphans.
 And now this, finally, a bishop with the courage to look the beast in the eye and speak its name out loud.
 Bishop Morlino does this in a moment when he is under heavy attack as a “hater” for defending the Church’s teaching on marriage—an attack, by the way, which prompted us here at The Remnant to join the fight to DEFEND BISHOP MORLINO last year.
 ""If you'll permit me, what the Church needs now is more hatred!
 As I have said previously, St. Thomas Aquinas said that hatred of wickedness actually belongs to the virtue of charity.
 As the Book of Proverbs says 'My mouth shall meditate truth, and my lips shall hate wickedness (Prov.
 8:7).'
 It is an act of love to hate sin and to call others to turn away from sin.
 – Bishop Robert Morlino
 This is what a courageous shepherd looks like!
 In our opinion, during the most vile clergy sex scandal in history, every bishop in the country must do exactly what Bishop Morlino has done, i.e., issue a statement of fidelity to the Church’s moral theology, specifically her teaching against the mortal sin of homosexual acts.
 In so doing, the bishops will incur the wrath of the enemies of the Church, yes.
 They will be crucified in the media, yes.
 But they will also be doing their sacred duty before God in reassuring their thoroughly scandalized flocks that they are absolutely committed to the defense and enforcement of the Church’s moral teaching at a time when it is under scurrilous attack from within.
 Nothing less will do.
 Bishop Morlino has now done it, and we respectfully demand that the rest of the American bishops either follow suit or face the charge of being complicit with the degenerate and even criminal shepherds, accounts of whose betrayal and vice now dominate the news.
 May God bless and keep Bishop Robert Morlino.

 Bishop Robert C. Morlino's letter to the faithful on the ongoing sexual abuse crisis in the Church
 August 18, 2018
 Dear brothers and sisters in Christ of the Diocese of Madison,
 The past weeks have brought a great deal of scandal, justified anger, and a call for answers and action by many faithful Catholics here in the U.S. and overseas, directed at the Church hierarchy regarding sexual sins by bishops, priests, and even cardinals.
 Still more anger is rightly directed at those who have been complicit in keeping some of these serious sins from coming to light.
 For my part — and I know I am not alone — I am tired of this.
 I am tired of people being hurt, gravely hurt!
 I am tired of the obfuscation of truth.
 I am tired of sin.
 And, as one who has tried — despite my many imperfections — to lay down my life for Christ and His Church, I am tired of the regular violation of sacred duties by those entrusted with immense responsibility from the Lord for the care of His people.
 The stories being brought into light and displayed in gruesome detail with regard to some priests, religious, and now even those in places of highest leadership, are sickening.
 Hearing even one of these stories is, quite literally, enough to make someone sick.
 But my own sickness at the stories is quickly put into perspective when I recall the fact that many individuals have lived through them for years.
 For them, these are not stories, they are indeed realities.
 To them I turn and say, again, I am sorry for what you have suffered and what you continue to suffer in your mind and in your heart.
 If you have not already done so, I beg you to reach out, as hard as that may be, and seek help to begin to heal.
 Also, if you’ve been hurt by a priest of our diocese, I encourage you to come forward, to make a report to law enforcement and to our Victim’s Assistance Coordinator, so that we might begin, with you as an individual, to try and set things right to the greatest extent possible.
 There is nothing about these stories that is okay.
 These actions, committed by more than a few, can only be classified as evil, evil that cries out for justice and sin that must be cast out from our Church.
 Faced with stories of the depravity of sinners within the Church, I have been tempted to despair.
 And why?
 The reality of sin — even sin in the Church — is nothing new.
 We are a Church made of sinners, but we are sinners called to sanctity.
 So what is new?
 What is new is the seeming acceptance of sin by some in the Church, and the apparent efforts to cover over sin by them and others.
 Unless and until we take seriously our call to sanctity, we, as an institution and as individuals, will continue to suffer the “wages of sin.”
 For too long we have diminished the reality of sin — we have refused to call a sin a sin — and we have excused sin in the name of a mistaken notion of mercy.
 In our efforts to be open to the world we have become all too willing to abandon the Way, the Truth, and the Life.
 In order to avoid causing offense we offer to ourselves and to others niceties and human consolation.
 Why do we do this?
 Is it out of an earnest desire to display a misguided sense of being “pastoral?” Have we covered over the truth out of fear?
 Are we afraid of being disliked by people in this world?
 Or are we afraid of being called hypocrites because we are not striving tirelessly for holiness in our own lives?
 Perhaps these are the reasons, but perhaps it is more or less complex than this.
 In the end, the excuses do not matter.
 We must be done with sin.
 It must be rooted out and again considered unacceptable.
 Love sinners?
 Yes.
 Accept true repentance?
 Yes.
 But do not say sin is okay.
 And do not pretend that grave violations of office and of trust come without grave, lasting consequences.
 For the Church, the crisis we face is not limited to the McCarrick affair, or the Pennsylvania Grand Jury Report, or anything else that may come.
 The deeper crisis that must be addressed is the license for sin to have a home in individuals at every level of the Church.
 There is a certain comfort level with sin that has come to pervade our teaching, our preaching, our decision making, and our very way of living.
 If you’ll permit me, what the Church needs now is more hatred!
 As I have said previously, St. Thomas Aquinas said that hatred of wickedness actually belongs to the virtue of charity.
 As the Book of Proverbs says “My mouth shall meditate truth, and my lips shall hate wickedness (Prov.
 8:7).” It is an act of love to hate sin and to call others to turn away from sin.
 There must be no room left, no refuge for sin — either within our own lives, or within the lives of our communities.
 To be a refuge for sinners (which we should be), the Church must be a place where sinners can turn to be reconciled.
 In this I speak of all sin.
 But to be clear, in the specific situations at hand, we are talking about deviant sexual — almost exclusively homosexual — acts by clerics.
 We’re also talking about homosexual propositions and abuses against seminarians and young priests by powerful priests, bishops, and cardinals.
 We are talking about acts and actions which are not only in violation of the sacred promises made by some, in short, sacrilege, but also are in violation of the natural moral law for all.
 To call it anything else would be deceitful and would only ignore the problem further.
 There has been a great deal of effort to keep separate acts which fall under the category of now-culturally-acceptable acts of homosexuality from the publically-deplorable acts of pedophilia.
 That is to say, until recently the problems of the Church have been painted purely as problems of pedophilia — this despite clear evidence to the contrary.
 It is time to be honest that the problems are both and they are more.
 To fall into the trap of parsing problems according to what society might find acceptable or unacceptable is ignoring the fact that the Church has never held ANY of it to be acceptable — neither the abuse of children, nor any use of one’s sexuality outside of the marital relationship, nor the sin of sodomy, nor the entering of clerics into intimate sexual relationships at all, nor the abuse and coercion by those with authority.
 In this last regard, special mention should be made of the most notorious and highest in ranking case, that being the allegations of former-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick’s (oft-rumored, now very public) sexual sins, predation, and abuse of power.
 The well-documented details of this case are disgraceful and seriously scandalous, as is any covering up of such appalling actions by other Church leaders who knew about it based on solid evidence.
 While recent credible accusations of child sexual abuse by Archbishop McCarrick have brought a whole slew of issues to light, long-ignored was the issue of abuse of his power for the sake of homosexual gratification.
 It is time to admit that there is a homosexual subculture within the hierarchy of the Catholic Church that is wreaking great devastation in the vineyard of the Lord.
 The Church’s teaching is clear that the homosexual inclination is not in itself sinful, but it is intrinsically disordered in a way that renders any man stably afflicted by it unfit to be a priest.
 And the decision to act upon this disordered inclination is a sin so grave that it cries out to heaven for vengeance, especially when it involves preying upon the young or the vulnerable.
 Such wickedness should be hated with a perfect hatred.
 Christian charity itself demands that we should hate wickedness just as we love goodness.
 But while hating the sin, we must never hate the sinner, who is called to conversion, penance, and renewed communion with Christ and His Church, through His inexhaustible mercy.
 At the same time, however, the love and mercy which we are called to have even for the worst of sinners does not exclude holding them accountable for their actions through a punishment proportionate to the gravity of their offense.
 In fact, a just punishment is an important work of love and mercy, because, while it serves primarily as retribution for the offense committed, it also offers the guilty party an opportunity to make expiation for his sin in this life (if he willingly accepts his punishment), thus sparing him worse punishment in the life to come.
 Motivated, therefore, by love and concern for souls, I stand with those calling for justice to be done upon the guilty.
 The sins and crimes of McCarrick, and of far too many others in the Church, bring suspicion and mistrust upon many good and virtuous priests, bishops, and cardinals, and suspicion and mistrust upon many great and respectable seminaries and so many holy and faithful seminarians.
 The result of the first instance of mistrust harms the Church and the very good work we do in Christ’s name.
 It causes others to sin in their thoughts, words, and deeds — which is the very definition of scandal.
 And the second mistrust harms the future of the Church, since our future priests are at stake.
 I said that I was tempted to despair in light of all of this.
 However, that temptation quickly passed, thanks be to God.
 No matter how large the problem, we know that we are called to go forward in faith, to rely upon God’s promises to us, and to work hard to make every bit of difference we can, within our spheres of influence.
 I have recently had the opportunity to talk directly with our seminarians about these very pressing matters, and I have begun to, and will continue to, talk with the priests of the diocese, as well as the faithful, in person and through my weekly column and homilies, making things as clear as I can, from my perspective.
 Here now, I offer a few thoughts to those of my diocese:
 In the first place, we must continue to build upon the good work which we have accomplished in protecting the youth and vulnerable of our diocese.
 This is a work on which we can never rest in our vigilance, nor our efforts to improve.
 We must continue in our work of education for all and hold to the effective policies that have been implemented, requiring psychological exams for all candidates for ministry, as well as across-the-board background checks for anyone working with children or vulnerable individuals.
 Here again, I state, as we have done consistently, if you have knowledge of any sort of criminal abuse of children by someone in the Church, contact law enforcement.
 If you need help in contacting law enforcement contact our Victim’s Assistance Coordinator and she will help connect you with the best resources.
 If you are an adult victim of sexual abuse from childhood, we still encourage you to reach out to law enforcement first, but even if you don’t want to, please still reach out to us.
 To our seminarians: If you are unchastely propositioned, abused, or threatened (no matter by whom), or if you directly witness unchaste behavior, report it to me and to the seminary rector.
 I will address it swiftly and vigorously.
 I will not stand for this in my diocese or anywhere I send men for formation.
 I trust that the seminaries I choose, very discriminately, to help form our men will not ignore this type of scandalous behavior, and I will continue to verify that expectation.
 To our priests: Most simply, live out the promises you made on your ordination day.
 You are called to serve Christ’s people, beginning with praying daily the Liturgy of the Hours.
 This is to keep you very close to God.
 In addition, you promised to obey and be loyal to your bishop.
 In obedience, strive to live out your priesthood as a holy priest, a hard working priest, and a pure and happy priest — as Christ Himself is calling you to do.
 And by extension, live a chaste and celibate life so that you can completely give your life to Christ, the Church, and the people whom he has called you to serve.
 God will give you the graces to do so.
 Ask Him for the help you need daily and throughout every day.
 And if you are unchastely propositioned, abused, or threatened (no matter by whom), or if you directly witness unchaste behavior, report it to me.
 I will not stand for this in my diocese any more than in our seminaries.
 To the faithful of the diocese: If you are the victim of abuse of any kind by a priest, bishop, cardinal, or any employee of the Church, bring it forward.
 It will be addressed quickly and justly.
 If you have directly witnessed sexual advances or any type of abuse, bring it forward as well.
 Such actions are sinful and scandalous and we cannot allow anyone to use their position or power to abuse another person.
 Again, in addition to injuring individuals, these actions injure the very Body of Christ, His Church.
 Furthermore, I add my name to those calling for real and sustained reform in the episcopate, priesthood, our parishes, schools, universities, and seminaries that would root out and hold accountable any would-be sexual predator or accomplice;
 I will hold the priests of the diocese to their promise to live a chaste and celibate life of service to you and your parish, and evidence of failure in this regard will be justly addressed;
 I will likewise hold every man studying for the priesthood for our diocese accountable to living a chaste and celibate life as part of his formation for the priesthood.
 Failure to do so will lead to dismissal from diocesan sponsorship;
 I will continue to require (with our men and our funds) that all seminaries to which we send men to study be vigilant that seminarians are protected from sexual predators and provide an atmosphere conducive to their holistic formation as holy priests, in the image of Christ;
 I ask all the faithful of the diocese to assist in keeping us accountable to civil authorities, the faithful in the pews, and to God Almighty, not only to protect children and the youth from sexual predators in the Church, but our seminarians, university students, and all the faithful as well.
 I promise to put any victim and their sufferings before that of the personal and professional reputation of a priest, or any Church employee, guilty of abuse;
 I ask everyone reading this to pray.
 Pray earnestly for the Church and all her ministers.
 Pray for our seminarians.
 And pray for yourselves and your families.
 We must all work daily on our own personal holiness and hold ourselves accountable first and, in turn, hold our brothers and sisters accountable as well, and
 Finally, I ask you all to join me and the entire clergy of the Diocese of Madison in making public and private acts of reparation to the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus and to the Immaculate Heart of Mary for all the sins of sexual depravity committed by members of the clergy and episcopacy.
 I will be offering a public Mass of reparation on Friday, September 14, the Feast of the Triumph of the Holy Cross, at Holy Name Heights and I ask all pastors to do the same in their own parishes.
 In addition, I ask that all priests, clergy, religious, and diocesan employees join me in observing the upcoming Autumn Ember Days (Sep. 19, 21, and 22) as days of fasting and abstinence in reparation for the sins and outrages committed by members of the clergy and episcopacy and I invite all the faithful to do the same.
 Some sins, like some demons, can only be driven out by prayer and fasting.
 This letter and these statements and promises are not intended to be an exhaustive list of what we can and need to do in the Church to begin to heal from, and stave off, this deep illness in the Church, but rather the next steps I believe we can take locally.
 More than anything else, we as a Church must cease our acceptance of sin and evil.
 We must cast out sin from our own lives and run toward holiness.
 We must refuse to be silent in the face of sin and evil in our families and communities and we must demand from our pastors — myself included — that they themselves are striving day in and day out for holiness.
 We must do this always with loving respect for individuals but with a clear understanding that true love can never exist without truth.
 Again, right now there is a lot of justified anger and passion coming from many holy and faithful lay people and clerics across the country, calling for real reform and “house cleaning” of this type of depravity.
 I stand with them.
 I don’t know yet how this will play out nationally or internationally.
 But I do know this, and I make this my last point and last promise, for the Diocese of Madison: “As for me and my household, we will serve the Lord.”
 Faithfully yours in the Lord,
 Most Rev.
 Robert C. Morlino
 Bishop of Madison

"Pope admits Catholic Church has ‘long ignored’ problem of child abuse
 
 VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis on Monday asked forgiveness for child abuse crimes and cover-ups within the Catholic Church, admitting that the pain of victims “was long ignored, kept quiet or silenced.”
 The strongly worded statement came ahead of an Aug. 25-26 papal pilgrimage to Ireland, one of the countries rocked by clergy sex abuse scandals, and followed an expose of pedophile priests in the U.S.
 “The heart-wrenching pain of these victims, which cries out to heaven, was long ignored, kept quiet or silenced,” Francis said in a Letter to the People of God, a rarely-issued address to the world’s 1.3 billion Catholics.
 On Aug. 17, a Pennsylvania grand jury report, based on hidden archives of the U.S. church, named 301 priests from the state as credibly accused child sex abusers and accused church leaders of a systematic cover-up of their crimes.
 The report “detailed the experiences of at least a thousand survivors, victims of sexual abuse, the abuse of power and of conscience at the hands of priests over a period of approximately seventy years,” Francis acknowledged.
 “It is essential that we, as a Church, be able to acknowledge and condemn, with sorrow and shame, the atrocities perpetrated by consecrated persons, clerics, and all those entrusted with the mission of watching over and caring for those most vulnerable,” he said.
 “Let us beg forgiveness for our own sins and the sins of others,” he added.
 In the run-up to Francis’ visit to Ireland, the head of the Irish Catholic Church, Archbishop Eamon Martin, said he expected the pope to meet with victims of clergy sex abuse and to promise effective remedies.
 “I’m not sure what his words will be and I’m not sure that a simple apology is what survivors of abuse want,” Martin said in a BBC interview.
 “If he expresses an apology, it needs to be more than ‘we’re sorry,’” he added.
 In his letter, Francis repeated a famous 2005 quote by his predecessor Benedict XVI, who, a month before being elected pope, lamented “how much filth” there was in the Catholic Church.
 “With shame and repentance, we acknowledge as an ecclesial community that we were not where we should have been, that we did not act in a timely manner, realizing the magnitude and the gravity of the damage done to so many lives.
 We showed no care for the little ones; we abandoned them,” Francis said.
 “Looking back to the past, no effort to beg pardon and to seek to repair the harm done will ever be sufficient.
 Looking ahead to the future, no effort must be spared to create a culture able to prevent such situations from happening, but also to prevent the possibility of their being covered up and perpetuated,” he added.
 Colm O’Gorman, an Irish abuse survivor who founded One in Four, the main survivors’ group in Ireland, commented on Twitter that the pope offered “Much stronger language than ever used before.”
 But O’Gorman added: “(The pope) begs for forgiveness, but still does not admit or own the deliberate policy of cover up designed & implemented by the #Vatican.”
 Like his predecessor, Francis has promised “zero tolerance” on child abuse, but scandals have kept recurring in several parts of the world — including in Australia recently.
 In January, the pope was accused of insensitivity and tone-deafness after insisting, during a visit to Chile, that local abuse survivors had no “proof” against a bishop who allegedly witnessed abuse and failed to report it.
 Following an outcry, Francis apologized for his remarks, held private meetings with victims at the Vatican, and, after envoys he sent to Chile backed up victims’ claims, the entire leadership of the Chilean Catholic church tendered their resignations.
 According to church expert John L Allen, an editor at specialized website Crux.com, the Catholic Church has a structural problem when it comes to dealing with cover up accusations.
 “Sixteen years since the crisis first erupted in the U.S., almost ten years since that happened in Ireland, and now more than five years since Francis was elected, the Catholic Church still has no credible, transparent process for handling cases when the accusation against a bishop isn’t the direct commission of abuse but rather covering up someone else’s crimes,” Allen said in a Sunday column.

"9 Steps to Successfully Counter Jihad
 
 [Pre-Order Jamie Glazov's new book, Jihadist Psychopath: How He Is Charming, Seducing, and Devouring Us, HERE.]
 Editors’ note: In light of the skyrocketing phenomenon of Muslim migrants stabbing unbelievers in random stabbing sprees in Europe, as well as the calculated denial that leaders, authorities and media are enforcing about it, Frontpage has deemed it important to bring attention to the crucial steps America and the West must take to robustly confront the unceasing onslaught by Jihad and its leftist enablers.
 We are, therefore, reprinting below Frontpage editor Jamie Glazov’s July 12, 2016 Breitbart article, ""9 Steps to Successfully Counter Jihad"".
 Having written the article in the closing chapter of the disastrous Obama administration, the author recognizes and celebrates the life-saving turn-around disposition that the Trump administration has brought in to counter Jihad.
 Frontpage is most confident that the suggested steps below will continue to be the overall focus of the new administration -- which, thankfully, is now taking many of the crucial and constructive steps vis-à-vis our enemy.
 We find the article more relevant and urgent than ever due to the 17th anniversary of 9/11 approaching tomorrow:

 9 Steps to Successfully Counter Jihad.
 By Jamie Glazov
 While the Obama administration continues to allow the Muslim Brotherhood to direct American foreign policy and, therefore, to implement “strategies” that render America defenseless in the face of Jihad and stealth Jihad, there are some alternative strategies that have the potential to turn this catastrophic situation around completely in America’s favor.
 Below are 9 concrete steps that, if implemented by a future American administration, would make a big difference in preserving our civilization and in defending Americans from terrorism:
 1.
 Label the Enemy and Make a Threat Assessment.
 The Obama administration continues to refuse to label our enemy and, therefore, it continues to enable our defeat in the terror war.
 It is urgent that we name our enemy (i.e.
 Islamic Jihad) and definitively identify what ideology inspires our enemy (i.e.
 Islamic law).
 2.
 Scrap “Countering Violent Extremism.”
 “Countering Violent Extremism” is the pathetic and destructive focus of the Obama administration in allegedly fighting the terror war.
 On the one hand, this “focus” is vague to the point of being meaningless and completely incapacitates us.
 On the other hand, this focus allows the administration to perpetuate the destructive fantasy that there are other types of “extremists” — who just happen to be the Left’s political opponents — that pose a great threat to the country.
 For example, as Stephen Coughlin has revealed, the “violent extremists” the administration is clearly worried about are the “right-wing Islamophobes” whom the administration obviously considers to be the real threat to American security.
 The “Countering Violent Extremism” is trash and needs to be thrown in the garbage.
 3.
 Stop “Partnering” With Muslim Brotherhood Front Groups.
 The government needs to stop cooperating with, and listening to, Muslim Brotherhood front groups such as CAIR and ISNA immediately.
 The Muslim Brotherhood document, the Explanatory Memorandum, has made it clear that the Brotherhood’s objective is to destroy our civilization from within by our own hands with the influence of these groups.
 Moreover, as Robert Spencer advises, there needs to be legislation that will bar all such groups and affiliated individuals from advising the government or receiving any grants from it.
 4.
 Implement a Concrete “Countering-Jihad” Strategy.
 After discarding the “Countering Violent Extremism” absurdity, a concrete Counter-Jihad strategy must become an official policy.
 It must specifically register that Jihadists are the enemies and that Islamic law (Sharia) is what specifically motivates them.
 Most importantly, as Sebastian Gorka urges in Defeating Jihad: The Winnable War, the government needs to lay down a vision, an actual “threat doctrine analysis” in a thorough document, just like George Kennan’s Long Telegram and NSC-68 did in laying out the strategic foundation to fighting communism in the Cold War.
 It is absolutely mind-boggling that nothing of this sort exists today in our terror war — and it is a reflection of the Left being in charge and of the destructive defeat that it is sowing.
 5.
 Launch Our Own Counter-propaganda Campaign.
 The Left and Islamists engage in propaganda 24/7.
 What does our propaganda war entail?
 Zilch.
 Sebastian Gorka is crucially correct, therefore, when he recommends a national counter-propaganda campaign that involves a two-part approach: the first being the bolstering of efforts to define our enemy (Steps #1 and #4 above) and, second, the strengthening of our allies and partners in their own counter-propaganda efforts – which must include our empowering of Muslims who are trying to form an anti-Jihadist version of Islam.
 Consequently, educational programs have to be set up everywhere, from public schools to universities to workplaces, in businesses and numerous other institutions.
 These programs must crystallize what exactly Islamic Law is and how it inspires and sanctions violence against unbelievers.
 This has to also involve, as Gorka urges, “a nationwide program of education that includes the armed services as well as federal, state, and local police forces and the intelligence community.”
 The education campaign must also focus on the second part of Gorka’s counter-propaganda campaign, which is to help strengthen Muslims who seek to seize Islam from the jihadists’ hands.
 6.
 Affirm Sharia’s Assault on the U.S. Constitution as Seditious.
 Once the truth is accepted that jihadis are inspired and sanctioned by their Islamic texts, it must logically become required that mosques, Islamic schools and groups have to immediately curtail any teaching that motivates sedition, violence, and hatred of unbelievers (i.e.
 remember how CAIR advised Muslims not to talk to the FBI).
 Indeed, once the government discerns and labels the elements of Islamic law that threaten the American Constitution, any preaching and spreading of those elements in America must be labelled as seditious.
 7.
 Put Pressure on Mosques, Islamic Groups and Schools.
 Authorities have to start subjecting mosques and other Islamic institutions to surveillance — and discard the suicidal leftist notion that it is “racist” and Islamophobic to do so.
 Islamic institutions have to be made to buffer their lip-service against terror with actually doing something about it.
 As Robert Spencer counsels, this has to involve introducing programs that teach against jihadists’ understanding of Islam — and these programs have to be regularly monitored by the government.
 (This will be a part of Gorka’s suggested counter-propaganda campaign discussed in Step #5).
 Spencer rightly stresses that the paradigm has to become that Muslim communities have to win the “trust” of intelligence and law enforcement agents, rather than the other way around, which is, absurdly and tragically, the case right now.
 8.
 Bring Counter-Jihadists into the Government.
 Instead of having Muslim Brotherhood sympathizers like Mohamed Elibiary serving on the U.S.
 Homeland Security Advisory Council (he “resigned” in Sept. 2014 under mysterious circumstances), and Muslim Brotherhood-linked individuals like Huma Abedin serving as the right-hand woman of Hillary Clinton, we need to bring in people who actually love America and want to protect it.
 We all know who these noble and courageous individuals are – and some of them are referenced in this article.
 The government must also bring in brave Muslim individuals who genuinely reject Jihad and empower them in propagating their anti-jihadist vision for Islam.
 (P.S.
 Yes, there is an argument to be made that Islam cannot be Islam without Jihad.
 But the debate over this belongs in another forum.
 And whatever the answer, it does not mean that the effort to empower Muslims who want to make the anti-jihadist Islamic vision possible should not be made.)
 9.
 Ridicule the Enemy.
 Ridicule is a vicious and potent weapon.
 There is a baffling and shameful silence in our culture’s sphere of comedy, especially in Hollywood and our media, with regard to the myriad ingredients of Sharia and Jihad that merit at least a million hilarious satirical sketches.
 Bill Maher, for whatever unappealing drawbacks he has in conservatives’ eyes, has set a bold standard in this respect in his Burka Fashion Show skit.
 American comedians need to start writing scripts that follow in Maher’s footsteps and Americans need to encourage and equip them to do so – and to also vigorously defend them from the attacks and slanders they will inevitably receive from totalitarian leftist and Islamic forces.
 We must never underestimate the crippling effect of comedy on the totalitarian Mullahs of the world.
 Indeed, the contemptuous, snickering and roaring laughter of people, as they gaze at the pathetic rules and lives of Sharia’s gatekeepers, poses a danger to tyrants like no other.

"Facebook Bans Outline to Stop Jihadi Attacks on Americans.
 
 [Editors' note: To best understand why Facebook would ban Jamie Glazov on 9/11 for his article on how to best prevent more 9/11s, pre-order Jamie's new book, Jihadist Psychopath: How He Is Charming, Seducing, and Devouring Us: HERE.

 Reprinted from WND.com.
 Somewhere in the “community standards” that Facebook demands everyone follow is a real doozy.
 The social-media company has told author and commentator Jamie Glazov that their standards forbid his article about how to prevent jihadi attacks on Americans.
 It’s all about Glazov’s new book, “Jihadist Psychopath: How He Is Charming, Seducing, and Devouring Us.”
 At FrontPage Magazine, where he is editor, he had posted “9 Steps to Successfully Counter Jihad,” which included recommendations such as “Label the enemy and make a threat assessment” and “Stop ‘partnering’ with Muslim Brotherhood front groups.”
 That apparently was too much for Facebook, which declared “only you can see this post” because it “goes against our Community Standards.”
 He was suspended from Facebook for 30 days on Sept. 11, the anniversary of the Islamic jihadist attack on America that killed nearly 3,000.
 Glazov told Breitbart, “This is really getting surreal in the creepiest and most harrowing Stalinist sense.”
 
 FrontPage Magazine reported:
 Facebook’s Unholy Alliance masters are, without doubt, accelerating their totalitarian suffocation of free thought and expression.
 It is no surprise, therefore, that Frontpage’s editor, and host of ‘The Glazov Gang,’ was suspended from Facebook for 30 days yesterday, on September 11, after posting his article, ‘9 Steps to Successfully Counter Jihad.’ Glazov believed that the article was more relevant and urgent than ever due to the skyrocketing jihadist stabbings in Europe — and to the 17th anniversary of 9/11 that was approaching the next day.
 The report said it appears “that daring to give suggestions on how our civilization can stop jihadist attacks and another 9/11 is against Facebook’s ‘community standards.
 '”
 “Glazov’s advice also involves the promotion of supporting moderate Muslims – a move that is, clearly, horrifying to Facebook’s masters and therefore also violates their ‘community standards,'” the report said.
 No doubt, Glazov’s consistent campaigning on behalf of Muslim women and girls in his efforts to protect them from FGM, honor killings and other Shariah barbarities, has gained him the anger and hatred of Facebook’s guardians — who are clearly on the side of the Shariah enforcers and oppressors of Muslim women and girls.
 The report recalls that Facebook censored Glazov in April for posting screenshots of a Muslim’s threat to him.
 Twitter also lashed out at him for quoting directly from Islamic religious texts, citing its anti-“hate” policies.
 It is ‘hateful conduct,’ apparently, to reference what Islamic texts themselves say.
 Indeed, Frontpage’s editor had simply referred to Sahih Bukhari’s texts discussing Mohammed’s marriage to Aisha when she was six years old (7.62.88) and to Quranic Suras that mandate the Hijab for women (24:31; 33:59) and sanction sexual slavery (4:3; 33:50).
 Facebook also refused to respond to Glazov’s inquiry about “what it is specifically that violates Facebook’s ‘community standards’ when a person gives advice on how to best defend American lives from jihad.”
 Glazov has written about the subject in previous books, including “High Noon for America: The Coming Showdown” and “United in Hate.”
 In his “9 Steps” article, he points out that the Obama administration was “cooperating with, and listening to, Muslim Brotherhood front groups such as CAIR and ISNA.”
 The government needs, he said, to “implement a concrete ‘countering-jihad’ strategy.”
 And he said it needs to affirm “Shariah’s assault on the U.S. Constitution as seditious.”
 A last key point, the said, is to ridicule the enemy.
 Ridicule is a vicious and potent weapon.
 There is a baffling and shameful silence in our culture’s sphere of comedy, especially in Hollywood and our media, with regard to the myriad ingredients of Shariah and jihad that merit at least a million hilarious satirical sketches.
 Bill Maher, for whatever unappealing drawbacks he has in conservatives’ eyes, has set a bold standard in this respect in his Burka Fashion Show skit.

"Facebook Lifts Frontpage Editor Jamie Glazov’s 9/11 Ban
 
 [Editors' note: To best understand why Facebook would ban Jamie Glazov on 9/11 in the first place, pre-order Jamie's new book, Jihadist Psychopath: How He Is Charming, Seducing, and Devouring Us: HERE.
 The book illustrates how the Jihadist Psychopath has, with the help of the Left, successfully built his totalitarian plantation in the West -- on which the political and cultural establishment is now enslaved and dutifully following his orders.
 Jamie outlines the frameworks of this tyrannical plantation and how those who are trapped on it, and yearn for freedom, can best escape.]
 Frontpage editors are happy to announce our free speech victory: Facebook has lifted Frontpage editor Jamie Glazov's 30-day ban on Facebook, apologizing and saying that the block was a “mistake”.
 We have no doubt, of course, that no “mistake” had actually occurred in this matter and that the ban has only been lifted because of the publicity that we engaged in -- and received.
 While it is a positive development that Facebook has lifted the ban on Jamie (for now), this story is crucial to amplify now more than ever, seeing that Facebook, and all of leftist-run social media, is, at this moment, clearly accelerating its totalitarian attack on the free speech of conservatives.
 (See Jamie's video on this whole surreal affair HERE).
 A brief recap of Jamie's story: on Sept. 11, the 17th Anniversary of the 9/11 terror strike, Facebook's Unholy Alliance masters informed Jamie that he was suspended from Facebook for 30 days due to his posting of his article, 9 Steps to Successfully Counter Jihad, which Facebook informed him violated their ""community standards.""
 This suggested, of course, that giving advice on how to prevent another 9/11, and all other Jihadist attacks against America, is now against Facebook’s ‘community standards’.
 (Read the whole story HERE.)
 Frontpage and Jamie immediately publicized this tyrannical behavior of Facebook.
 Then, yesterday, on Sept. 13, Facebook notified Jamie that it had made a mistake and that it was lifting his block.
 It goes without saying that this retraction and surrender by Facebook occurred only because of the wide publicity that Jamie's banning had received.
 And we are immensely grateful for all the massive support that was given to us across the Internet, including especially from Breitbart, PJMedia, WorldNetDaily and Thomas Lifson at American Thinker.
 Leading brave conservative figures such as Michelle Malkin and Laura Loomer also stood up for Jamie, tweeting about his ban -- and to them we send our heartfelt appreciation.
 Jamie is, of course, no stranger to social media censorship -- especially of the insane variety.
 The Counter Jihad Coalition's (CJC) Facebook page, which Jamie helped run with CJC President Steve Amundson, was removed a few years ago with absolutely no explanation.
 The CJC is a human rights and pro-national security group that is dedicated to protecting America and the West from Jihad -- and Muslim and non-Muslim people from Sharia oppression.
 The question remains: why would Facebook remove such a page, let alone in such a fascistic manner -- and never explain why?
 In April earlier this year, Jamie was suspended from Facebook for posting screenshots of a Muslim's threat to him on the platform.
 Then, in May, his Twitter account was temporarily suspended and he was forced to delete tweets he posted which directly quoted Islamic religious texts.
 His account was suspended for violating Twitter’s rules relating to “hateful conduct.” It is ""hateful conduct"", apparently, to reference what Islamic texts themselves say.
 Indeed, Frontpage's editor had simply referred to Sahih Bukhari’s texts discussing Mohammed’s marriage to Aisha when she was six years old (7.62.88) and to Qur'anic Suras that mandate the Hijab for women (24:31; 33:59) and sanction sexual slavery (4:3; 33:50).
 One thing we know for sure is that, despite this lifting of Jamie’s ban, Facebook and the leftist totalitarians in other social media venues and in the culture at large will continue their unrelenting effort to suffocate dissent and conservative voices.
 On Facebook, many brave conservative truth-tellers continue to be censored in myriad ways; these individuals include Anni Cyrus, Bosch Fawstin, Mark Lutchman and, of course, Diamond & Silk.
 The case of #WalkAway leader Brandon Straka is especially disturbing: he was recently banned by Facebook for the crime of announcing that he would be interviewed by Alex Jones.
 Prager U has had its videos mysteriously disappear off of Facebook and then, only after vociferous protest, re-appear.
 Facebook is, of course, just one terrain of this leftist brownshirt-style assault on free speech.
 Everyone knows by now, for instance, what has happened, in the most Orwellian sense, to Alex Jones and InfoWars on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter.
 Leading scholar of Islam and JihadWatch.org Director Robert Spencer, meanwhile, is not just a target at Facebook, where his referrals are down 90% from what they once were; he has been banned by Patreon at the behest of MasterCard -- and MasterCard has yet to respond to his lawyer’s letter.
 GoFundMe has also banned Spencer because of a smear by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) hate machine.
 Speaking of Mastercard, the David Horowitz Freedom Center just recently won a major battle with the credit card, defeating well-financed leftwing groups that are trying to run the Center out of business and suffocate free speech in America.
 The Freedom Center emerged victorious, but it is clear that leftist hate groups such as the SPLC and Color of Change.org are preparing new attacks against the Freedom Center and other conservative groups and individuals 24/7.
 To be sure, the Left's attacks on the David Horowitz Freedom Center continue unabated: just recently a hit piece in the Washington Post smeared a stand-up noble gentleman like Florida Gubernatorial Candidate Republican Ron DeSantis, libeling David Horowitz in the process.
 The article stated falsely and maliciously that Horowitz's Restoration Weekend, that DeSantis had attended, was somehow “a racially charged event” -- a vicious lie that Frontpage has exposed and for which the Washington Post is still to apologize and issue a retraction.
 (To learn why David Horowitz is one of the central targets of the Left, make sure to watch this video).
 Thus, we clearly gauge that there is no disgusting and venomous level to which the Left will not stoop in its destructive agenda.
 Yes, Frontpage editor Jamie Glazov has had his ban lifted at Facebook, but this is clearly only a brief reprieve for him on that platform -- and it is only, obviously, a very tiny space in the Stalinist Left's war on America and on everything on which it stands.
 At this dire moment, we all need to amplify our voices in defense of free speech.
 And we need to adamantly defend all the truth-tellers at the very moment they come under attack.
 We also need to contact our representatives and to call for a Congressional investigation into this pernicious assault by the fascist Left on our liberties.
 The battle for America -- and for the West -- is on.

"Nimesh Patel Stand-Up Routine Cut Short Due To Uncomfortable Jokes
 
 Nimesh Patel, a comedian known for being the first Indian-American writer for Saturday Night Live, had his stand-up routine at cultureSHOCK cut short earlier tonight due to uncomfortable jokes.
 cultureSHOCK, an event hosted by the Asian American Alliance, is a charity performance showcase that aims to provide a space to celebrate Asian American expression.
 Patel was one of the main events promoted beforehand.
 However, his jokes quickly progressed to uncomfortable territory, including one about a gay black man who lives in his neighborhood and how “[I]t made me realize that being gay is definitely not a choice because no one wants to be gay and black.” The tension in the room increased as Patel told more jokes in this vein until organizers of the event went up on stage to stop him, citing a change in program plans.
 Patel questioned why this was happening.
 The organizers replied that the person in charge of tech had to leave early, but Patel continued to claim that he was being cut off because the audience didn’t like his jokes.
 At one point, one organizer told Patel he was being disrespectful.
 When asked for closing remarks, Patel responded: “I’m a generation older than all of you I know comedy,” and called the organizers incorrect in ending his set.
 He tried to continue speaking until his mic was cut.
 We have reached out to the Asian American Alliance for comment and were told that their board is not yet prepared to release a statement.
 We will update this post if such a statement is forthcoming.

"Student organizers boot SNL writer from stage during standup routine for jokes deemed offensive
 
 Saturday Night Live writer and comedian Nimesh Patel was pulled from the stage by event organizers after telling jokes that were criticized as racist and homophobic during his performance at cultureSHOCK: Reclaim, an event held by Columbia Asian American Alliance on Friday night.
 Patel, 32, was the first Indian-American writer for SNL, and has since been nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing.
 Patel has previously performed on Late Night with Seth Meyers and opened for comedians such as Chris Rock.
 During the event, Patel’s performance featured commentary on his experience living in a diverse area of New York City—including a joke about a gay, black man in his neighborhood—which AAA officials deemed inappropriate.
 Patel joked that being gay cannot be a choice because “no one looks in the mirror and thinks, ‘this black thing is too easy, let me just add another thing to it.’”
 About 30 minutes into Patel’s set, members of AAA interrupted the performance, denounced his jokes about racial identities and sexual orientation, and provided him with a few moments for closing remarks.
 Compared to his other jokes, ones specifically targeting sexual orientation audibly receive less laughter from the crowd.
 Patel pushed back on the officials’ remarks, and said that while he stood in solidarity with Asian American identities, none of his remarks were offensive, and he was exposing the audience to ideas that would be found “in the real world.” Before he could finish, Patel’s microphone was cut from off-stage, and he proceeded to leave.
 cultureSHOCK, an annual charity showcase featuring a fashion show, productions by various student groups and a famous performer, aims to provide a platform for Asian American artistic expression and breakthrough harmful stereotypes.
 Neither Patel and nor AAA could immediately be reached for comment.
 Adam Warren, CC ‘22, was in the audience Friday night.
 Warren said that AAA made the right decision to remove Patel from the stage due to the nature of his jokes, which contradicted the sensitive nature of the event itself.
 “The message they were trying to send with the event was opposite to the jokes he was making, and using people’s ethnicity as the crux of his jokes could be funny but still offensive...He definitely wasn’t the most crass comedian I’ve ever heard but for the event it was inappropriate,” Warren said.
 However, audience member Elle Ferguson, BC ‘22, said that while comedians can push the boundaries of social culture, she had heard similar jokes before and did not find them offensive.
 “While what some of the things that he said might have been a bit provoking to some of the audience, as someone who watches comedy a lot, none of them were jokes that I hadn’t heard before and none of them were jokes that elicited such a response in my experience,” Ferguson said.
 “[AAA] should have talked to him beforehand especially because comedy is known for being ground-breaking and for pushing boundaries.”
 For Sofia Jao, BC ‘22, problems with the performance resided not in the set, but with Patel’s closing remarks.
 “I really dislike when people who are older say that our generation needs to be exposed to the real world.
 Obviously the world is not a safe space but just accepting that it’s not and continuing to perpetuate the un-safeness of it… is saying that it can’t be changed,” said Jao.
 “When older generations say you need to stop being so sensitive, it’s like undermining what our generation is trying to do in accepting others and making it safer.”

"Don Lemon Is Lying... Again: Biggest Threat Isn't ""White Men"" - The FBI's Most Wanted Domestic Terrorists Are These People
 
 “So, we have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in this country is white men, most of them radicalized to the right.
 And we have to start doing something about them.
 There is no travel ban on them.
 There is no ban on — they had the Muslim ban.
 There is no white guy ban.
 So, what do we do about that?” –Don Lemon
 Just to illustrate the absurdity of Don Lemon’s comments, I thought it would be fun to go look at the current list of the FBI’s most wanted terrorists.
 Below is the list of “domestic” terrorists and, regardless of the list/filter you choose, you won’t find many “white men”.
 Interestingly enough, it looks like the WOMEN in this country are currently responsible for more terrorism than WHITE MEN.
 Mr.
 Lemon, you are very wrong.
 Below are the 14 profiles currently listed as the “Most Wanted Domestic Terrorists”

 5 women.
 3 Hispanic men.
 3 black men (one with an Arabic/possibly Islamic surname), and 3 white guys.
 14 total and only 3 white men?
 Is Don Lemon colorblind?
 Is the FBI racist (and maybe a bit sexist)?
 Nah, it’s just CNN doing what CNN does… spewing more fake news for your viewing pleasure.
 Go to https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/terrorism and see for yourself.
 No matter which category you choose, you won’t be finding many white men.

"CNN's Don Lemon Contradicts Himself In Just One Sentence: ""We Have to Stop Demonizing People ... White Men, Most Of Them Radicalized""
 
 Talk about an absolute hypocrite!
 However, it comes as no surprise from a hypocrite who works for a hypocritical, lying, fake news outlet like CNN.
 Don Lemon wanted to defend the ""peaceful"" migrants who are headed toward the US border to illegally enter the country against our immigration laws, but said that the ""biggest terror threat in this country is white men, most of them radicalized to the right.""
 How can he contradict himself like that and not even bat an eyelid?
 In discussing the arrival of these migrants who obviously gotten incredible help along the way, busted through customs gates, and pushed at the Mexican border while committing all sorts of crimes against many they come in contact with along the way, Lemon said what is clearly not only racist but utterly insane.
 ""We have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in this country is white men, most of them radicalized to the right, and we have to start doing something about them,” Lemon said.

 He then said people need to stop thinking these people are a threat.
 “I keep trying to point out to people not to demonize any one group or any one ethnicity, but we keep thinking the biggest terror threat is something else,” Lemon said.
 No one is demonizing an ethnicity but Don Lemon.
 He is the one demonizing white men.
 How's that for hypocrisy?
 He's a useful idiot, propagandist snowflake.
 Demonizing the ideology behind Islamic jihad is not an ethnic issue.
 It's an ideological one that spans cultures, just like Don Lemon's and Chris Cuomo's statism.
 Demonizing those intent on violating the law and have demonstrated that they are doing it along the way and declaring that we will not allow such persons across our border is simply common sense, but you won't get common sense on CNN.
 Don Lemon thinks things like this, are just fine, and wants these people in the US.
 He just doesn't want white men here.
 There, I said it!

"Undercover Video: Andrew Gillum Staffer: “None of the programs that people are hoping for would happen”
 
 Florida gubernatorial candidate and George Soros-backed Andrew Gillum may have just been completely undercut by a member of his own staff.
 Not that his racist, anti-semite claims against his opponent weren't enough, one of his staffers has been caught in an undercover video saying, “None of the programs that people are hoping for would happen” and that is to be kept confidential from the public.
 In a new undercover video from Project Veritas, Omar Smith, who is a staffer for Gillum and claims to have also attended college with him, said that if Gillum is elected “None of the programs that people are hoping for would happen.”

 When asked whether that would be important for voters to know that or not, Smith said, “That’s not for them to know.”
 Of course, anyone following what Gillum has been promoting knows he isn't planning on delivering just like many politicians.
 “So, let’s go back to Mr. Gillum’s platform, right?” said Smith.
 “Raise the corporate tax in Florida from 7 to 11 percent.
 That will never happen.
 Raise teacher’s pay to $50,000, that will never happen.
 Give me another position.
 Medicare for all, that will never happen.”
 What's even more amazing, but not surprising, is that Gillum has claimed that his opponent is a racist, but the video demonstrates the utter racism of Smith, which one can then conclude that Gillum knows about Smith's racism and keeps him on staff anyway.
 “This is a f***ed up state,” said Smith.
 “It’s a cracker state.”
 Smith also stated that the campaign has “to appeal to white guilt.”
 Good luck with that!
 It gets worse though.
 Smith says that Gillum is “a progressive” who is “a part of the crazy, crazy, crazies.”
 NEW: The honesty of Gillum's campaign staff on undercover video is refreshing, especially when it comes to who the real Andrew Gillum is.
 While trying to appear as a moderate, ""Gillum is a Progressive"" and ""He is a part of the crazy, crazy, crazies.""

 OK, we know that, but if that is true, what sort of useful idiot is Smith?
 A pretty big one if you ask me.
 Gillum is not a lawful man as he does not support the right to keep and bear arms, but rather considers Americans as criminals who need to prove their innocence before obtaining a gun.

 “I do think he’s not saying specifically, like, I’m going to ban bump stocks or I’m against ARs, only because he’s running a race right now,” said Adrian Young, who serves as the Community Engagement Specialist for the Florida Democratic Party.
 “I do think he would support anybody doing that stuff, Bill Nelson … But I don’t think he can say it, just cause he’s trying to get the moderates and the gun-toting people in North Florida.”

"Hillary Cracks Racist Joke After Mixing Up Cory Booker & Eric Holder: ""They All Look The Same""
 
 So, you were actually asking yourself who the real people are who engage in identity politics and viewing people with different skin colors or ethnic backgrounds as inferior people?
 Well, this didn't come from President Donald Trump.
 Nope, Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton mixed up Senator Cory Booker and former Attorney General Eric Holder and blew it off with a joke saying, ""They all look the same.""
 Hillary Clinton sat down with Recode’s Kara Swisher over the weekend to talk propaganda against her conservative political opponents and how mean, nasty and evil they have been in the past few months.
 “What’s often called political correctness is politeness,” Clinton said.
 “It’s not being rude and insulting to people.
 It’s respecting the diversity that we have in our society.""

 “The Democratic Party is a much more diverse political party, attracting people who are African-American, Latino, LGBT, whatever the reason why people feel more comfortable where they are taken in, where they are included as part of a political movement or party” she added.
 “And I don’t think it’s politically correct to say we value that,"" she concluded.
 ""And I don’t want to go around insulting people.
 I don’t want to paint with a broad brush every immigrant is this, every African-American is that, every, you know, other person with different religious beliefs or whatever – that’s childish.”
 Right, except she does just that and so do many in her party.
 However, in less than a minute she would insult both Booker and Holder, and every person with dark skin on the planet.
 Swisher asked her, ""What do you think of Cory Booker… saying ‘kick them in the shins,’ essentially?""
 Of course, Swisher meant Eric Holder and Clinton corrected her, adding, “Yeah, I know they all look alike.""
 What was even more amazing is that the audience laughed hysterically.
 Can you imagine if a conservative person uttered those comments?
 There would be a near lynching of them on the spot and surely for days to come.
 They might lose their livelihood and get death threats, but not ""Crooked"" Hillary.
 Clearly, she was speaking of all black people and not being specific to Holder or Booker as they look nothing alike.
 The only thing the two of them have in common is that they are criminals and have black skin.
 Clinton's comments were clearly racist, and those fawning over her during the interview laughed it up right along with her.
 Here, take a look!
 Disgusting that she continues to move and speak freely in this country with no justice being brought to bear on her for her many crimes, something we were promised from then-candidate Trump.

 On November 16, 2012, Somali-born Minnesota state Rep. Ilhan Omar (D), who’s currently running for the state’s 5th Congressional District seat, sent out the following tweet:
 Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.
 #Gaza #Palestine #Israel
 In May of this year, Twitter user John Gilmore dug up the six-year-old tweet, forcing Omar to defend herself.
 She responded: “Drawing attention to the apartheid Israeli regime is far from hating Jews.
 You are a hateful sad man, I pray to Allah you get the help you need and find happiness.”
 Omar’s initial tweet came three days after “Palestinian terrorists in Gaza launched more than 150 rockets at Israel” from November 10-13, 2012, reports the Jewish Virtual Library.
 On November 14, the Israeli Air Force killed Ahmad Jabari in an air strike.
 Jabari, the military commander of Hamas, was allegedly responsible for, or instrumental in, multiples terrorist attacks on Israeli civilians and military personnel since the 1990s.
 On November 15, another terrorist-launched rocket killed three Israeli civilians.
 This and other rocket launches from Palestinian militants in Gaza prompted Israel to initiate Operation Pillar of Defense.
 According to Israel’s official New York consulate website, during the operation, “the IDF targeted over 1,500 terror sites including 19 senior command centers, operational control centers and Hamas’ senior-rank headquarters, 30 senior operatives, damaging Hamas’ command and control, hundreds of underground rocket launchers, 140 smuggling tunnels, 66 terror tunnels, dozens of Hamas operation rooms and bases, 26 weapon manufacturing and storage facilities and dozens of long-range rocket launchers and launch sites.”
 Omar defended herself against charges of anti-Semitism in a July interview with ABC News, saying: “These accusations are without merit.
 They are rooted in bigotry toward a belief about what Muslims are stereotyped to believe.”
 The oft-repeated notion that Israel is an “apartheid” nation is incorrect on multiple grounds.
 Perhaps the most succinct refutation of this idea comes from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which writes:

"Records Support Claims That Minnesota Muslima State Rep Ilhan Omar Married Her Brother
 
 Ilhan Omar has accused Israel of “evil doings” in Gaza and called Israel an “apartheid state.” It isn’t surprising that Ilhan Omar would think this way.
 She is a hijab-wearing, devout Muslim, and Islamic Jew-hatred is in the Quran.
 What is shameful about this is that her views are mainstream in the Democrat Party today.
 She should never have been chosen as a candidate for Congress with hateful views of this kind, but this is the way the Democrat leadership, and the Democrat base, thinks.
 They want candidates like Ilhan Omar.
 And they know they’ll win, because this is their base today.

 Neither the Democrat leadership nor the Democrat base cares that she married her brother.
 She is a Muslim and a leftist, so she can further their identity politics.
 That’s all that matters to them.

 Fox News also reported that Sinema “promoted events at Arizona State University featuring a lawyer convicted for aiding an Islamist terror organization and its leader.
 Sinema, a co-founder of the activist group Local to Global Justice, invited people in a now-closed Yahoo group to attend two events with Lynn Stewart, both in 2003.
 At the time of the invite, Stewart had been charged with helping her former client Omar Abdel Rahman, a radical Egyptian spiritual leader of a terror group, to pass on secret messages to his followers to commit terror attacks.”
 The Left maintains that Islamic jihad terror is not a problem — it’s just a reaction to the evil deeds of the U.S. and Israel.
 “Islamophobia,” Leftists insist, is a much greater issue.
 This is the result: Useful Idiots such as Kyrsten Sinema end up promoting the likes of Lynne Stewart, who was convicted of aiding the jihad mass murder plotting of the Blind Sheikh, Omar Abdel Rahman, who masterminded the 1993 World Trade Center.
 If you don’t recognize the reality, nature, and magnitude of the jihad threat, you may well end up abetting the jihad.
 Sinema is proof: the Left hates America, and considers “right-wing extremists,” a term all too often applied to American patriots, far more of a threat than jihad terrorists.
 It used to be that this fact was dismissed as hysterical hyperbole.
 Now it is becoming increasingly clear.

"Keith Ellison Defends Louis Farrakhan: ""He Had Something To Offer""
 
 Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN), aka Hakim Muhammad, recently defended his ties to Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, who recently paralleled Jews with termites.
 During a debate with Republican opponent Doug Wardlow, Ellison was asked about his previous support of Farrakhan, but then claims that he has distanced himself from Farrakhan.
 Yeah, right, Hakim!
 Understand that Ellison attempts to tell the audience and his opponent that he has distanced himself from Farrakhan since the 1990s.
 Take a look at his comments.

 “I absolutely, unqualifiedly denounce and reject the views of Louis Farrakhan,"" said Ellison.
 ""I’ve said that many, many years ago.”
 “Look, in the early 1990s, Louis Farrakhan was a person speaking the issues of African-American civil rights,"" Ellison added.
 ""At that time, he had some things, I thought, he had to offer.""
 Ellison then concluded, ""He made it very clear in the early 90s that his views and mine were absolutely incompatible, and I’ve been saying that ever since.”
 Keith, you're lying.
 It's clear from video evidence that Ellison and fellow Democrat Gregory Meeks had dinner with Farrakhan and Iranian leader President Hassan Rouhani in 2013.
 Take a look for yourself and understand how pathological liar and accused woman abuser Keith Ellison seeks to deceive you.
 In case you missed it, here's a still frame of Ellison just a few feet away from a man who has called on 10,000 blacks to stalk and murder white people.
 Both of these men have the same devil as their father because both men are following after the teaching of the Koran .
 One of them just actually has the nerve to say it.
 The other doesn't.
 Maybe Ellison is attempting to pull an Obama.
 Remember when Obama's ""pastor,"" Jeremiah Wright uttered ""God damn, America!""?
 Obama tried to say he had been in that church for years and never heard such things, which isn't true.
 Ellison is attempting to do that same.
 However, as Michael Ahrens of GOP.com tweeted, Ellison knew what kind of man Farrakhan was then and what kind of man he still is today.
 Ahrens tweeted, “In 1993, Farrakhan told women: “You’re a failure if you can’t keep a man.” In 1994, Farrakhan said: “Murder and lying comes easy for white people.” All this came *before* Ellison praised him as “a role model” in 1995, and was photographed selling Farrakhan’s newspaper in 1998.”

 Ellison is a totalitarian-minded individual, who has been supported by Communists and Islamists alike.
 As the old saying goes, ""If you like down with dogs, you're going to get fleas.""
 Consider Keith Ellison to be a flea-infested political con man.

"Our New Muslim Representatives
 
 As expected, two Muslim women, Rashida Tlaib in Michigan and Ilhan Omar in Minnesota, have been overwhelmingly elected to Congress.
 The establishment media will celebrate these victories as triumphs of America’s “diversity”; unfortunately, in reality neither one is worth celebrating.
 Tlaib is a vociferous foe of Israel.
 With the Democrats now regaining control of the House, Tlaib is likely to be an energetic proponent of the new majority’s vendetta against the Middle East’s only democracy.
 The House is likely to do all it can to roll back President Trump’s pro-Israel polices, with Tlaib as well as Omar as becoming the public faces of the effort.
 According to the JTA, when Tlaib was asked if she would vote against military aid to Israel, Tlaib responded: “Absolutely, if it has something to do with inequality and not access to people having justice.
 For me, U.S. aid should be leverage.
 I will be using my position in Congress so that no country, not one, should be able to get aid from the U.S. when they still promote that kind of injustice.”
 What kind of injustice?
 Tlaib, of course, had nothing to say about the genocidal incitement against Jews and Israel that regularly features on Palestinian television.
 She did say, however, that she favors a one-state, not two-state, “solution” to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: “One state.
 It has to be one state.
 Separate but equal does not work.
 I’m only 42 years old but my teachers were of that generation that marched with Martin Luther King.
 This whole idea of a two-state solution, it doesn’t work.”
 Indeed it doesn’t.
 A Palestinian state would be a new base for renewed jihad attacks against Israel.
 But a “one-state solution” would be even worse, unless that state is the current State of Israel, but that is not the one state Tlaib has in mind.
 She is calling for an Israeli/Palestinian state that would not be a Jewish State or a homeland for the Jewish people, but a federation in which Palestinians would soon overwhelm Jews demographically.
 Progressive denial of their rights would soon follow: as I show in my book The History of Jihad From Muhammad to ISIS, there has never been a majority Muslim nation in which Jews enjoyed equality of rights with Muslims.
 Tlaib’s unitary state would be no different.
 The hijabed (and therefore pro-Sharia) Ilhan Omar, meanwhile, is even more hateful than Tlaib.
 According to the Daily Wire, in 2012 Omar tweeted: “Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.
 #Gaza #Palestine #Israel.” Challenged about this tweet much more recently, she doubled down and attacked the man who called attention to the tweet: “Drawing attention to the apartheid Israeli regime is far from hating Jews.
 You are a hateful sad man, I pray to Allah you get the help you need and find happiness.”
 There is much, much worse about Omar.
 David Steinberg of PJ Media has done extraordinary work in shedding light on aspects of Omar’s record that the establishment media has steadfastly ignored.
 Steinberg reports that Omar has “faced allegations -- soon backed by a remarkable amount of evidence -- that she had married her own brother in 2009, and was still legally his wife.
 They officially divorced in December 2017.
 The motivation for the marriage remains unclear.
 However, the totality of the evidence points to possible immigration fraud and student loan fraud.” What’s more, she swore to apparent falsehoods in court.
 But Leftists rarely have to answer for their corruption, and in a Democrat House, Omar will much more likely be celebrated than investigated.
 She and Tlaib will enjoy establishment media accolades as they pursue their hard-Left, anti-American, anti-Israel agenda.
 Their presence in the House of Representatives may be evidence of “diversity,” but it is also a disquieting sign of the continued dominance of identity politics, and the increasing balkanization of the American body politic.
 Forthrightly pro-America, pro-Israel candidates would stand little to no chance in either of their districts.
 And that is indicative of a much larger problem.

"“They All Look The Same” – Hillary Cracks Racist Joke After Booker/Holder Mix-Up
 
 This article was originally published by Tyler Durden at Zero Hedge
 Being the paragon of political-correctness and queen of virtue-signaling opportunism, Hillary Clinton sat down with Recode’s Kara Swisher this weekend to answer questions about just how evil and awful conservative opponents have been in the last few months.
 The conversation began normally, with Clinton hypocritically toeing the progressive line of identity politics by explaining how each of the groups are different but can be managed by the same liberal movement:
 “What’s often called political correctness is politeness,” Clinton said.
 “It’s not being rude and insulting to people.
 It’s respecting the diversity that we have in our society,” she said.
 “The Democratic Party is a much more diverse political party, attracting people who are African-American, Latino, LGBT, whatever the reason why people feel more comfortable where they are taken in, where they are included as part of a political movement or party.” “And I don’t think it’s politically correct to say we value that.
 And I don’t want to go around insulting people.
 I don’t want to paint with a broad brush every immigrant is this, every African-American is that, every, you know, other person with different religious beliefs or whatever – that’s childish.”
 Childish, indeed.
 Insulting, indeed.
 Just 30 seconds later, as Swisher asked:
 “what do you think of Cory Booker… saying ‘kick them in the shins,’ essentially…” incorrectly recalling Eric Holder’s recent comments.
 Which Clinton quickly corrected:
 “Well that was Eric Holder…”
 Adding, rather extraordinarily,
 “Yeah, I know they all look alike,” Clinton joked, triggering howls of laughter from the apparently mind-numbed audience.
 Sorry Hillary, we don’t think they look anything alike.
 Or did you mean all black people?
 Finally, we have one question – what would have happened if Trump said it?
 As The American Mirror’s Kyle Olsen concludes so eloquently, Hillary Clinton appears to benefit from her progressive privilege – it is the only thing that protects her from getting the ‘Roseanne treatment’, and not being dismissed in disgrace.

"Democrat’s Friend Louis Farrakhan In Iran: “Death to America!” – America Is The “Great Satan”
 
 Ah yes, Nation of Islam leader, racist, and totalitarian Louis Farrakhan was recently captured on video in Tehran, Iran chanting “Death to America” in Arabic and stating that America is the “Great Satan.”
 Louis Farrakhan, leader of Nation of Islam, met with Mohsen Rezaee, secretary of Iran‘s Expediency Discernment Council, on Sunday in Tehran.
 Heres’ what he had to say.

 He then went on in a university speech to encourage the revolution and to persevere against the sanctions of the US, whom he referred to as the “Great Satan.”

 Algemeiner reported:
 Nation of Islam leader and prominent antisemite Louis Farrakhan chanted “Death to America” and claimed that “America has never been a democracy” on Sunday during a solidarity trip to Iran, ahead of the re-implementation of US sanctions on the country this week.
 According to Iran’s semi-official state news agency Mehr, Farrakhan said at a meeting with the Secretary of Iran’s Expediency Council Mohsen Rezaei that America is conspiring against Iran.
 “I understand how the enemies have plotted against the Iranian people and I would like to stay alongside you to stop their plots,” he said.
 He also blasted American support for Saudi Arabia, Iran’s arch-rival in the region, and added, “Satan seeks to divide Muslims and wants them to kill each other, while God tells us in the Quran to be united.”
 This man is a domestic terrorist and he assimilates with avowed enemies of the US, many of them US Democrats.
 What I want to know is why would Louis Farrakhan ever be allowed back inside our borders after such statements?
 Is this not treason of the first order?
 Furthermore, why are Democrats such as Keith Ellison, who has a long history of friendship with Farrakhan, despite the lies he tells to try and distance himself from Farrakhan for votes, not being arrested for his ties to this criminal traitor?
 And Ellison isn’t the only Democrat who approves of Farrakhan!

 This is a breaking news story.
 Refresh the page for updates.
 (Tallahassee) Project Veritas Action Fund has released undercover video from Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum’s campaign, revealing his election strategy includes making empty promises to voters.
 This is the seventh undercover video report Project Veritas has released in a series revealing secrets and lies from political campaigns in 2018.
 Said James O’Keefe, founder and president of Project Veritas Action:
 “What we found in the Gillum campaign was just what we found in Missouri, Tennessee and Arizona, a candidate lying to the voters he needs to win the election.”
 Gillum campaign makes promises it knows it can’t keep
 Featured in this report is a campaign staffer who works on Andrew Gillum’s gubernatorial campaign.
 Omar Smith, who says he went to college with Gillum, reveals Gillum cannot fulfill his campaign promises even if he wanted to.
 When asked how Gillum would fund all the programs he says he wants to fund, Smith says Gillum “can’t,” and when asked if voters are aware that Gillum cannot deliver on his proposed programs, Smith says:
 SMITH: “That’s not for them to know… That’s not for them to know.
 Remember our saying, modern day fairy tales start with ‘once I am elected.
 '”
 Smith explains that most of Gillum’s campaign promises could never be implemented, and that the Gillum campaign knows this:
 SMITH: “So, let’s go back to Mr. Gillum’s platform, right?
 Raise the corporate tax in Florida from 7 to 11 percent.
 That will never happen.
 Raise teacher’s pay to $50,000, that will never happen.
 Give me another position.
 Medicare for all, that will never happen.
 The reason being, the legislature that write the bills is all Republican controlled.
 Democratic governor, Republican legislature.
 So, unless the legislature writes a bill, and it got voted on the floor, it cannot pass.”
 Smith says that “the rules in Florida are f***ed up” and that Florida is a “cracker state,” explaining that the Florida legislature has to become racially black for Gillum’s agenda to advance.
 “Whip up” the poor into a “frenzy in order for them to vote.”
 Smith says that in order to get voters on board with Gillum’s fairy tale platform, the campaign must “whip” lower income individuals “into a frenzy.”
 SMITH: “You whip ’em up.
 The poor, the middle income.
 You have to whip them up into a frenzy in order for them to vote.
 Once Gillum is in, in another 2 years, other Republican Senators and Legislators will be on the ballot.
 So, you have to whip up the Andrew Gillum voters again in those counties to vote out the Republican to get a Democratic Legislature in order for his (Gillum) will to be executed.”
 Smith adds that because not all Democratic voters are the same, that the Gillum campaign needs to appeal to “white guilt” to turn out the vote:
 SMITH: “You have to appeal to white guilt… [be]cause that’s what it is.”
 Smith also explains that the Gillum campaign can’t let voters know what Gillum’s true agenda is before election day:
 SMITH: “… We don’t, do we have to let [the voters] know what the agenda is ahead of time?
 We can’t… We cannot… You alienate everybody.
 Then you get painted like, oh, Gillum is being painted, no.
 You are a socialist, you are way out of left field…”
 Gillum is a “crazy, crazy,” Democrat
 Smith also explains Gillum’s political worldview, saying that “Gillum is a progressive… He is a part of the crazy crazy crazies.”
 Cliff Eserman, who works for the Broward County Democratic Party adds that during the Democratic primary, Gillum had to campaign on values he does not really believe:
 ESERMAN: “In order to win he had to be… He’s really left of center.
 So he was being left, not left of center… For the primary.
 Now [in the general] he’s going back to left of center.”
 Dale Holeness, who is the Broward County Commissioner and also works on Gillum’s campaign, explains Gillum’s gun control views:
 HOLENESS: “There ought to be at least a three-day waiting period for everybody and a full background check for everybody… And we need to- And these automatic guns with sixteen rounds a minute, they ought to not be on the streets either, so that’s his plan.”
 Adrian Young, who works for the Florida Democratic Party also elaborates on Gillum’s gun control views in the report:
 YOUNG: “… I do think he’s not saying specifically like I’m going to ban bump stocks or I’m against ATs, only because he’s running a race right now.
 I do think he would support anybody doing that stuff, Bill Nelson… But I don’t think he can say it just [be]cause he’s trying to get the moderates and the gun-toting people in North Florida…”

 Give me another position.
 Medicare for all; that will never happen.
 The reason being, the legislature that write the bills is all Republican-controlled.
 Democratic governor, Republican legislature.
 So, unless the legislature writes a bill, and it got voted on the floor, it cannot pass.
 The full video shows Smith saying that the strategy to change the Florida legislature is to take “poor” and “middle income” people and “whip them up into a frenzy in order for them to vote.”
 He adds that “you have to appeal to white guilt.”
 Smith defines Gillum’s political beliefs as “part of the crazy crazy crazies” on the progressive Left.
 More damaging footage includes Democratic operatives explaining Gillum’s positions on gun control and indicating he would support banning AR-15 rifles.
 Florida Democrat Party community engagement specialist Adrian Young also admits on video that Gillum is not campaigning with that position because it would be unpopular with Florida voters.
 “I do think he’s not saying specifically like I’m going to ban bump stocks or I’m against ARs, only because he’s running a race right now.
 I do think he would support anybody doing that stuff, Bill Nelson.
 … But I don’t think he can say it just [be]cause he’s trying to get the moderates and the gun-toting people in North Florida.”
 “What we found in the Gillum campaign was just what we found in Missouri, Tennessee and Arizona, a candidate lying to the voters he needs to win the election,” said Project Veritas Action President James O’Keefe.
 The video evidence confirms that Gillum is lying to Florida voters.
 Will there be wall-to-wall coverage in the media eviscerating Gilllum for making promises he can’t keep?
 Will Gillum be asked to denounce his campaign staffer using a racial slur to demean white voters in Florida?

"SNL Indian Comedian Silenced for ""Offensive Jokes"" at Columbia
 
 Andy Warhol was only half-right.
 In the future everyone will be the subject of social justice crybullying for 15 minutes.
 Also the Left killed comedy.
 This is what its corpse looks like.
 Saturday Night Live writer and comedian Nimesh Patel was pulled from the stage by event organizers after telling jokes that were criticized as racist and homophobic during his performance at cultureSHOCK: Reclaim, an event held by Columbia Asian American Alliance on Friday night.
 Patel, 32, was the first Indian-American writer for SNL, and has since been nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing.
 Patel has previously performed on Late Night with Seth Meyers and opened for comedians such as Chris Rock.
 During the event, Patel’s performance featured commentary on his experience living in a diverse area of New York City—including a joke about a gay, black man in his neighborhood—which AAA officials deemed inappropriate.
 Patel joked that being gay cannot be a choice because “no one looks in the mirror and thinks, ‘this black thing is too easy, let me just add another thing to it.’”
 That's what Columbia snowflakes thought was offensive.
 I can't imagine what they would have made of Richard Pryor, or at this point even, Chris Rock.
 It's also a version of a Sammy Davis Jr joke about converting to Judaism.
 Which is now a hate crime.
 About 30 minutes into Patel’s set, members of AAA interrupted the performance, denounced his jokes about racial identities and sexual orientation, and provided him with a few moments for closing remarks.
 Comrades, these jokes you have been listening to are thought crimes!
 Patel pushed back on the officials’ remarks, and said that while he stood in solidarity with Asian American identities, none of his remarks were offensive, and he was exposing the audience to ideas that would be found “in the real world.” Before he could finish, Patel’s microphone was cut from off-stage, and he proceeded to leave.
 The real world?
 This is Columbia.
 For Sofia Jao, BC ‘22, problems with the performance resided not in the set, but with Patel’s closing remarks.
 “I really dislike when people who are older say that our generation needs to be exposed to the real world.
 Obviously the world is not a safe space but just accepting that it’s not and continuing to perpetuate the un-safeness of it… is saying that it can’t be changed,” said Jao.
 “When older generations say you need to stop being so sensitive, it’s like undermining what our generation is trying to do in accepting others and making it safer.”
 Patel is 32.
 I'm sure Patel felt very, like, accepted.
