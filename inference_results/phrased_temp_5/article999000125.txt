Doubt: AAA made the right decision to remove Patel from the stage due to the nature of his jokes,

Doubt: I really dislike when people who are older say that our generation needs to be exposed to the real world,
Doubt: While what some of the things that he said might have been a bit provoking to some of the audience, as someone who watches comedy a lot, none of them were jokes that I hadn’t heard before and none of them were jokes that elicited such a response in my experience,
Doubt: None of his remarks were offensive,
Doubt: AAA officials deemed inappropriate,

Doubt: Obviously the world is not a safe space but just accepting that it’s not and continuing to perpetuate the un-safeness of it… is saying that it can’t be changed,
Doubt: Patel pushed back on the officials’ remarks
