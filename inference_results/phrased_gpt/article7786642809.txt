Loaded_Language: "horrific scandal," "hideous violation," "gross dereliction of duty," "an ideology of evil," "immortal souls of the sheep"
Name_Calling,Labeling: "Father Martin and his pals in the episcopacy," "the so-called 'gay lifestyle'"
Repetition: "it is not," "it cannot," "it will not"
Exaggeration,Minimisation: "the Church's new-found 'climate of tolerance' is exactly what McCarrick and company are counting on!"
Appeal_to_fear-prejudice: "everlasting damnation is the price to be paid for this kind of inclusivity and toleration"
Causal_Oversimplification: "Until the Church and her bishops get back to reaffirming traditional Catholic teaching on human sexuality we can forget about seeing an end to the sexual abuse crisis"
Whataboutism: "Are Father Martin and his pals in the episcopacy really so enlightened over every pope, saint, and moral theologian in history?"
Doubt: "Does Archbishop Hebda believe it is time for the Church to stop humiliating herself by stooping to accommodate a special interest group?"
Red herring: "But, practically speaking--in the real world--this kind of 'accompaniment' is only green-lighting vice and mortal sin"
Bandwagon: "Is it any wonder that priests and laity alike are changing their attitude on the 'gay lifestyle' and violations of the Sixth Commandment"
Obfuscation,Intentional_Vagueness,Confusion: "this kind of 'accompaniment' is only green-lighting vice and mortal sin, and as such constitutes a hideous violation of everything these bishops supposedly believe as Catholic priests"
Straw man: "the Church's constant and unchanging moral teaching on this makes no such allowance"
