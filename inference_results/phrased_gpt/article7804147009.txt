Appeal_to_fear-prejudice: "the homosexual inclination is not in itself sinful, but it is intrinsically disordered in a way that renders any man stably afflicted by it unfit to be a priest," "the deeper crisis that must be addressed is the license for sin to have a home in individuals at every level of the Church."
