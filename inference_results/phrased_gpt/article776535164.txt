Loaded_Language: "purges the names of his predecessors," "failed to protect children from dozens of predators priests," "credibly accused of sexual misconduct involving children," "reeling over the revelations," "sanctioned by Pope Francis," "credibly accused of sexually abusing at least two boys"
Exaggeration,Minimisation: "no other Catholic prelate has conducted such a blanket purge of his predecessors' legacies"
