Causal_Oversimplification: "the Uranium One deal never should have gone through"
Whataboutism: "But we know that the FBI’s confidential informant was actively compiling incriminating evidence as far back as 2009"
Doubt: "Is he ready to be the Mayor?"
Red herring: "Meanwhile, journalists John Solomon and journalist Sara Carter claim to have copies of the FBI informant’s evidence"
Bandwagon: "I hope AG Sessions gets briefed about the CI and gives the Uranium One case the scrutiny it deserves"
