Loaded_Language: "illegal alien criminals," "rapists and child sex offenders," "tipping off criminals committing a felony."
Name_Calling,Labeling: "Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf," "Obama holdovers."
Appeal_to_fear-prejudice: "tipped off illegal alien criminals to ICE raids resulting in rapists and child sex offenders escaping arrest."
Causal_Oversimplification: "Because there is no doubt that businesses employing illegal aliens are committing a crime."
Doubt: "Schaaf refuses to say how she learned about the ICE raids, only saying it was not from official sources."
Red herring: "we didnâ€™t find out who her sources were, but we do know who she was talking to before she made her big announcement."
